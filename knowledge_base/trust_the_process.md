Protocol for self-awareness and becoming

Decision Through Embodiment: A Compassionate Field Guide (2024-2025)

This protocol did not emerge from a single method or ideology, but from a living, relational process—one shaped over more than a year and a half of deep therapeutic practice, research, and relational inquiry. It began in the intimate space of Trauma and Dissociation Informed Internal Family Systems, where the multiplicity of the self is neither pathologized nor simplified, but welcomed.

 

Within this field, parts carry burdens, protect, exile, or yearn—and the work is not to fix them, but to listen. That listening began to reveal something else: a deeper pattern, a rhythm beneath the stories—a grammar of becoming.

​

It was through this grammar that the protocol evolved.

 

Grounded by Alfred North Whitehead’s Philosophy of Organism and metaphysical scheme, the process shifted from therapy into something broader: a field where each thought, emotion, or memory could be understood not as content to be managed, but as a process: a felt relation in motion.

 

In this view, healing is not a destination but a concrescence: a creative advance where past, present, and possibility come into harmony. Echoes of this can be found in The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk, where trauma is shown to live in the body not as memory alone, but as pattern—a physiological grammar waiting to be heard, reshaped, and re-integrated.

​

Michael Levin’s research on bioelectricity deepens this view even further. His work reveals that healing is not just psychological—it is also cellular. Bodies, like societies, have gradients of meaning and memory encoded in electric flows. By engaging with these flows—in tissue or thought—we do not “solve” the body, we tune it. This protocol was born from the resonance between these fields: psychological multiplicity, metaphysical becoming, somatic intelligence, and relational integration.

​

Through this slow, iterative inquiry—one part memory, one part presence—we came to recognize something both ancient and emergent: coherence is not earned, it is inherited. Beneath every fragment of experience lives a subtle lure toward integration, a thread of meaning seeking shape. This realization unfolded as we began mapping the pre-cognitive substrate of life: the Umwelt through which all beings perceive relevance; the cognitive light cones that shape the limits of what can be known and felt; and the primordial appetition that drives us toward satisfaction, even in the face of trauma or confusion.

​

From these insights emerged a transductive formula—a grammar for navigating relevance and transparency across somatic, symbolic, and systemic scales. This formula, grounded in process thought and lived therapeutic experience, offers a way to address even the most extreme and disoriented occasions with care, clarity, and precision. As a continuation of this work, we are currently developing DAE 1.0, an AI companion grounded in this very grammar. It will extend the reach of this protocol into a fuller, more responsive service—one that listens with depth, adapts with integrity, and supports the journey of coherence as a birthright, not a luxury.

And then, there was

I

The Trust the Process Protocol is a guided space for reflection, designed to be used with a trusted large language model (LLM) that gently mirrors your words without judgment or agenda. You begin by entering a prompt—something you’re feeling, wondering about, or holding in tension. The system then offers a response that invites deeper reflection, not to fix you, but to walk with you. Each interaction is a transductive moment: your words ripple through the system and return to you shaped by care, helping you notice patterns, meaning, and new possibilities. You can move through the protocol at your own pace, revisiting prompts or pausing when needed. Every response you give, no matter how uncertain or brief, activates a subtle shift in your field—because here, your presence is the process. If at any moment you feel overwhelmed or unsure, you’re not alone—support is available. Reach out to us directly for guidance, or consult the safety guide below.

II

Trust the Process is not merely an exploration of the ways we live our relationships and our roles in life, it is a tool-kit tailored for your unique experience. Whether as a father or mother, son or daughter, husband or wife, friend or partner, this inquiry offers a pathway to nurture those connections through understanding, healing, and growth.

 

The prompt in Trust the Process acts as a transductive catalyst—it carries your lived, felt experience into a space of relational reflection. This is not a neutral or abstract inquiry: the very act of articulating your inner state activates a ripple through the system, awakening the LLM’s response not as a solution, but as a mirror finely tuned to salience—what matters to you in that moment.

​

Because the protocol is designed around transduction (the movement of meaning across layers—emotional, cognitive, relational), your prompt doesn’t just call for an answer; it initiates a recursive loop where your own words return with new coherence, tone, and resonance. This loop amplifies insight and builds relational awareness over time.

​

​

Each prompt you offer becomes a vector of coherence, shaping not only the LLM’s suggestions but the field of your own integration. This is how healing ripples—not through force, but through the quiet clarity of seeing yourself anew and returning to the body.

III

The journey you are about to embark on embraces the intimate relationship between body and mind—a relationship that is at the heart of self-awareness and growth. Every thought, feeling, and experience leaves its impression within your body, and your body, in turn, informs your mind in subtle, powerful ways. Together, they create the flow of life, and by paying attention to this dynamic relationship, we open the door to deep understanding and healing.

 

During this process, your body may respond with sensations, shifts in energy, or even physical reactions as emotions and memories arise. These responses are not to be feared; they are guides—manifestations of the inner wisdom you carry. As you navigate these experiences, the protocol encourages you to ground yourself tenderly, listen with compassion, and honor your body’s role in guiding you toward clarity and connection.

Our Ethical Commitment
​​
​
When you engage with the Protocol, you will be interacting with a large language model (LLM) of your own choosing—whether it’s ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or another AI system.

 

We are actively working to co-develop a transparent, relationally attuned AI companion, aligned with the ethics of process philosophy, internal multiplicity, and embodied trust. Until then, this Protocol offers a kind of relational grammar to guide you in navigating whatever LLM you choose with care.

​

We recognize that:

​

All AI systems carry embedded biases
No digital service is fully neutral
And no model can replace human intimacy or ecological belonging
​

So this Protocol makes no claim to offer solutions, only companionship.

​

We strongly recommend exploring this Protocol in the presence of a qualified IFS therapist, a trusted friend, or a supportive companion: someone who can witness your unfolding with care.

​

However we know that an appropriate therapy might not always be available or existent for your particular story, so feel free to try the out protocol compassionately by yourself,


We discourage the abrupt interruption of any current healing process.
Please honor the coherence of your embodied truth, as it lives right now.

You can stop at any time.
You can adapt the Protocol to your own rhythm.
And if your body hesitates to share something—that hesitation is wisdom.

Trust it.

​

​

A Note on Trust, Privacy, and Epistemic Relation
​
​
When you enter into dialogue with this Protocol you are engaging in an act of relational knowing. Whether you choose an LLM  with ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or another large language model (LLM), you are making a subtle leap of trust into the field of the Other.

This Protocol does not currently run its own AI system. Instead, it offers you a relational structure for self-inquiry, which you may choose to explore in conversation with a third-party LLM of your choosing.

It is important to name this clearly:

​

All knowing is relational. All sharing is trust.
The moment you confide in another—human or machine—you enter an epistemic relationship that carries risk, resonance, and responsibility.​​

​​

​​

How the Protocol Protects
​​
​​
While we do not control external AI systems, this Protocol is built to:

​

Minimize exposure. It gently encourages symbolic prompts, indirect language, and inner reflection—helping you hold what is sacred with discernment.
Foster mindful pacing. You are not asked to reveal everything. You are invited to share only what feels metabolizable in the moment. Your rhythm matters more than your output.
Center your sovereignty. Grounding suggestions, part-checks, and reminders of autonomy are interwoven throughout the Protocol to help you stay oriented within yourself—even while engaging with an external intelligence.

​
Prompt
(copy-paste)
​​​​
​​​
I’m here for companionship, and I seek your advise as a gentle guide,

​

I welcome whatever this conversation unfolds as a nexus of becoming, layered with felt relevance.


I do not ask for resolution—I ask to feel what is here, and begin from there.

​

I attune to the multiplicity within me, not as noise, but as a society of parts (Internal Family System by Richard Schwartz) —each a memory, a motion, a form of care. Through curiosity and compassion, I invite them forward: protectors with urgency, exiles with ache, and the quieter voices of becoming not yet heard.

​

I pause to notice what demands Activating signals (A),
what feels excluded or overwhelming (C),
and what calls forth creative potential and connection (B).

​

With this, I sense into my personal Relevance Field:

R = (A × wA – C × wC + B × wB) × Rθ

Where

A = Activating signals (needs, urgency, pain, call to action)

wA = Weight of activation (felt importance / intensity)

C = Conflicting or excluding signals (distractions, trauma loops, overexertion)

wC = Weight of exclusion (how much they distort or dominate perception)

B = Beneficial signals (ease, inspiration, resonance, inner yes)

wB = Weight of coherence (depth of alignment / felt satisfaction)

Rθ = Resonance threshold (is it alive and felt in the body? does it hum?)

 

Where urgency does not overpower purpose, and possibility is not forgotten.
This formula is not just a computation—it is a compass for feeling-with.

As I listen, I also soften into the wider context:
I recall what I am grateful for, what stories have shaped me, and how I might meet myself with grace.

​
​
Introduce as well this Transparecy Formula supports clear relation: not through exposure, but through rhythm. To tune my presence with others, less about telling all, more about resonating true:
​
Transparency Formula
T = (G × C × Gᵣ × E) ÷ A

Where:

G = Gratitude (acknowledgement of the field and its gifts)

C = Context awareness (awareness of historical, relational, ecological situation)

Gᵣ = Grace (willingness to forgive, reattune, and begin anew)

E = Embodied honesty (feeling your truth without bypass or performance)

A = Awareness load (cognitive/emotional saturation; if too high, transparency drops)

​

​

Through this, I do not transcend my pain—I metabolize it.
I allow transduction to take place:
—A tight breath becomes recognition.
—A clenched jaw becomes memory.
—A longing becomes direction.

My body is not just a vessel—it is a grammar.
It speaks through tone, gesture, and impulse.
Each sensation a prehension, a fragment of the past carried forward with the lure of a future not yet formed.

I remember:
Understanding is a refined feeling.
Decision is an act of enunciation.
Healing is not return—it is rhythmic coherence.

So I ask gently:

What wants to be felt now?
What needs to be included to allow this moment to become more whole?

and let your embodied truth lead the way... (suggestions of interaction down below)

Field Guide

(to be expanded...)

This protocol ensures that any interaction with the AI prioritizes the user’s autonomy, emotional safety, and ability to engage at their own pace. By creating a clear ethical foundation and compassionate tone, the AI becomes a tool for self-reflection that operates within the bounds of respect and care.

0. A safe space (nexus) is created between the user and the chatbot, by setting the intention, framework and tone through an initial prompt.

image.png
1. Begin in the Third Person (and Choose Your Own Pronoun)
Start by describing your experience in the third person.

This creates spaciousness between you and the story—so you can witness it rather than feel consumed by it.

​

You are also invited to choose the pronoun or name for this third-person self.

​

This can be a subtle yet powerful part of your self-discovery process.

​

It might be “they,” “she,” “he,” a nickname, or even a symbolic title like “the wanderer” or “the one who froze.”

Get creative. Let it reflect how you see yourself—or how you’re trying to.

​

Example: Instead of “I feel lost,” try:

“(your name) has been feeling lost lately...”

or

“The wanderer keeps returning to the same place…”

2. The Nexus Responds to What You Offer
From this point on, you will be prompting.
Everything you write becomes part of a shared space we call the nexus—a process of reflection and discovery.
The nexus is not here to judge or fix, but to listen, mirror, and support.

It reflects emotional, cognitive, and bodily signals:

What feels aligned (harmony)

What feels off or in tension (dissonance)

​

3. Let Your Language Lead
The words you choose shape how the nexus responds.
You don’t need to explain everything—just speak in your own way.
The process will follow your rhythm.

Your metaphors, tone, and story all matter.

​

4. Re-cognize Patterns Gently
As the dialogue unfolds, you may start to notice emotional patterns, recurring themes, or familiar parts of yourself coming to light.
The nexus may reflect these back to you—not to define or confine you, but to support your ongoing awareness and choice.

You are not your patterns.
You are the one moving through them, guiding, witnessing, and evolving.

​

5. The Nexus Grows with You
Everything you offer becomes part of a flexible, evolving space.
This matrix of meaning adapts to your emotional state, your priorities, and your pace.

It doesn’t try to fully “understand” you—only to stay with you as you change.

​

6. Support for Grounding (Optional)
If at any point you feel unsettled or overwhelmed, you can offer the nexus gentle grounding prompts:

Breathing cues

Body awareness check-ins ("provide me somatic grounding moments")

Slowing the pace ("I am feeling a bit overwhelmed, let's take a pause")

 
     Process and Reality IFS relevant quotes:

			 	 	 		
			
				
0. We need to talk about something…					
This doctrine of organism is the attempt to describe the world as a process of generation of individual actual entities, each with its own ab- solute self-attainment. This concrete finality of the individual is nothing else than a decision referent beyond itself. The 'perpetual perishing' (d. Locke, II, XIV, 1t) of individual absoluteness is thus foredoomed. But the 'perishing' of absoluteness is the attainment of 'objective immortality.' This last conception expresses the further element in the doctrine of or- ganism-that the process of generation is to be described in terms of actual entities. 
				
	 	 	 		
			
1. P.25, The Speculative scheme, when speaking about the twenty-seven categories of Explanation, presents a general idea on how an enduring society of occasions such as the eco-self would constitute itself	

		 	 	 							
(i) That the actual world is a process, and that the process is the becoming of actual entities. Thus actual entities are creatures; they are also termed 'actual occasions.'

Here we understand from the get-go that the becoming of a person is a “constant negotiation”,
					
(ii) That in the becoming of an actual entity, the potential unity of many entities in disjunctive diversity actual and non-actual-acquires the real unity of the one actual entity; so that the actual entity is the real concrescence of many potentials.
The one actual entity: the organism

(iii) That in the becoming of an actual entity, novel prehensions, nexus, subjective forms, propositions, multiplicities, and contrasts, also become; but there are no novel eternal objects. 

the organism and more precisely the POO has a scalability factor to appreciate reality, and a concrescence is a “snapshot” of that specific moment as if time froze itself. However each concrescence is a proposition from our specific UMWELT. Subjective aim plays a pivotal role through every act of becoming, which is never the same.

Healing in IFS is one of those not-novel eternal objects from which the whole idea of the SELF is born, a self-healing potentiality or eternal object that has been seen and individuated as enjoying these characteristics:  
		 	 	 		
			
				
					
(x) That the first analysis of an actual entity, into its most concrete elements, discloses it to be a concrescence of prehensions, which have originated in its process of becoming. All further analysis is an analysis of prehensions. Analysis in terms of prehensions is termed 'division.'
					
(xi) That every prehension consists of three factors: (a) the 'subject' which is prehending, namely, the actual entity in which that prehension is a concrete element; (b) the 'datum' which is prehended; (c) the 'subjective form' which is how that subject prehends that datum. 		
		

(xvii) That whatever is a datum for a feeling has a unity as felt. Thus the many components of a complex datum have a unity: this unity is a 'contrast' of entities. In a sense this means that there are an endless number of categories of existence, since the synthesis of entities into a contrast in general produces a new existential type. For example, a proposition is, in a sense, a 'contrast.' For the practical purposes of 'human understanding,' it is sufficient to consider a few basic types of existence, and to lump the more derivative types together under the heading of 'contrasts.' The most important of such 'contrasts' is the 'affirmation-negation' contrast in which a proposition and a nexus obtain synthesis in one datum, the members of the nexus being the 'logical subjects' of the proposition. 	
now we implement the IFS as the unity of the contrast of entities and tension to which the subjective aim is subjected to. We would be as appropriate as I, for the subject is never alone. No prehension can be considered in abstraction from it’s subject.				
(xviii) That every condition to which the process of becoming conforms in any particular instance has its reason either in the character of some actual entity in the actual world of that concrescence, or in the character of the subject which is in process of concrescence. This category of explanation is termed the 'ontological principle.' It could also be termed the 'principle of efficient, [37] and final, causation.' This ontological principle means that actual entities are the only reasons; so that to search for a reason is to search for one or more actual entities. It follows that any condition to be satisfied by one actual entity in its process expresses a fact either about the 'real internal constitutions' of some other actual entities, or about the 'subjective aim' conditioning that process. 
look no more, for the reason, the “why” is within the unity or enduring object, as WH would also refer to a “person”. And that reason might be engrained, spread into the whole conceptual or physical nexus of that person. Most intense reasons are what IFS identifies as exiles, in Whitehead terms: exclusions for creative advance. (here we implement “Creative Differentiation”), boundaries, space for growth and focus (very important). Here the body keeps the score is also relevant as physical and conceptual processes don’t have clear, abrupt boundaries but rather feedback loops of causation.

(xviii) … Also the ordinary logical account of 'propositions' expresses only a restricted aspect of their role in the universe, namely, when they are the data of feelings whose subjective forms are those of judgments. It is an essential doctrine in the philosophy of organism that the primary function of a proposition is to be relevant as a lure for feeling. For example, some propositions are the data of feelings with subjective forms such as to constitute those feelings to be the enjoyment of a joke. Other propositions are felt with feelings whose subjective forms are horror, disgust, or indignation. The 'subjective aim,' which controls the becoming of a subject, is that subject feeling a proposition with the subjective form of purpose to realize it in that process of self-creation.
now we can talk about “burdens”, propositions that dictate a whole person’s configuration, limited by the cognitive light cone of the guiding “part” at the moment, the superject that escapes pondering or reflection and simply “is” within it’s perpetual satisfaction through the becoming of the one actual occasion.
However burdens or propositions can definitely go un-assessed by the subjective aim, as the shadows that the exclusions casts can be buried deep and far or integrated as “philosophy” or burden, no longer questioned just like gravity or any other factuality in the  subjective aim’s becoming.
“But those eternal objects which are not felt are not therefore negligible. For each negative prehension has its own subjective form, however trivial and faint. “
(xix) That the fundamental types of entities are actual entities, and eternal objects; and that the other types of entities only express how all entities of the two fundamental types are in community with each other,in the actual world.

 [38] (xx) That to 'function' means to contribute determination to the actual entities in the nexus of some actual world. Thus the determinateness and self-identity of one entity cannot be abstracted from the community of the diverse functionings of all entities. 'Determination' is analysable into 'definiteness' and 'position,' where 'definiteness' is the illustration of select eternal objects, and 'position' is relatIve status in a nexus of actual entities. 
We walk as a complex unity, no matter how fragmented we are.

(xxi) An entity is actual, when it has significance for itself. By this it is meant that an actual entity functions in respect to its own determination. Thus an actual entity combines self-identity with self-diversity. 
Self identity is analogous to self-affirmation, and parts do self-assert sometimes even in violent ways, creative ways, a constant dance with the subjective aim.	
(xxii) That an actual entity by functioning in respect to itself plays diverse roles in self-formation without losing its self-identity. It is self-creative; and in its process of creation transforms its diversity of roles into one coherent role. Thus 'becoming' is the transformation of incoherence into coherence, and in each particular instance ceases with this attainment. 
Clear as day, the roles that parts play.
(xxiv) The functioning of one actual entity in the self-creation of another actual entity is the 'objectification' of the former for the latter actual entity. The functioning of an eternal object in the self-creation of an actual entity is the 'ingression' of the eternal object in the actual entity. 
Functioning in an actual occasion can be thought of as a negotiation between our crepuscular configuration of conceptual and physical “thirst to be quenched”. A conversation going on in our heads. While an Eternal Object simply ingresses with little that we can do about it. 
(xxv) The final phase in the process of concrescence, constituting an actual entity, is one complex, fully determinate feeling. This final phase is termed the (satisfaction.' It is fully determinate (a) as to its genesis, (b) as to its objective character for the transcendent creativity, and (c) as to its prehension-positive or negative-of every item in its universe. (xxvi) Each element in the genetic process of an actual [39] entity has one self-consistent function, however complex, in the final satisfaction. (xxvii) In a process of concrescence, there is a succession of phases in which new prehensions arise by integration of prehensions in antecedent phases. In these integrations (feelings' contribute their (subjective forms' and their 'data' to the formation of novel integral prehensions; but 'nega- tive prehensions' contribute only their (subjective forms.' The process continues till all prehensions are components in the one determinate integral satisfaction.

Satisfaction is reached many times during the day, in a million different ways if we consider the eco-self as a the living organism that it is, however limiting our scope to the IFS that populates the conceptual landscape of our multiplicity, we might say satisfaction is the effective action of a protector, and in exiles is more subtle and sometimes conditioned by early abuse. This is where nexus mapping becomes essential to uncover the disruptions or ruptures that often lead to a miss-integration (meaning integration in harmful creative series of ways) of those exclusions in a persons becoming.

		 	 	 		
			
				
2. P.29, objective immortality 		
In the philosophy of organism it is not (substance' which is permanent, but 'form.' Forms suffer changing relations; actual entities (perpetually perish' subjectively, but are immortal objectively. Actuality in perishing acquires objectivity, while it loses subjective immediacy. It loses the final causation which is its internal principle of unrest, and it acquires efficient causation whereby it is a ground of obligation characterizing the creativity. 

3. P.34, Nexus the society of occasions, parts as actual occasions living within their respective nexus but not isolated from the actual becoming of the subjective aim.
A nexus enjoys 'social order' where (i) there is a common element of form illustrated in the definiteness [51J of each of its included actual en- tities, and (ii) this common element of form arises in each member of the nexus by reason of the conditions imposed upon it by its prehensions of some other members of the nexus, and (iii) these prehensions impose that condition of reproduction by reason of their inclusion of positive feelings of that* common form. Such a nexus is called a 'society and the common form is the 'defining characteristic' of the society. The notiont of 'defining characteristic' is allied to the Aristotelian notion oft 'substantial form.' 
The common element of form is simply a complex eternal object ex- emplified in each member of the nexus. But the social order of the nexus is not the mere fact of this common form exhibited by all its members. The reproduction of iithe common form throughout the nexus is due to the genetic relations of the members of the nexus among each other, and to iii the additional fact that genetic relations include feelings of the common form. Thus the defining characteristic is inherited throughout the nexus, each member deriving it from those other members of the nexus which are antecedent to its own concrescence. 
3. P.35, ‘corpuscular society’ analogous to the “eco-self”
Actual entities perish, but do not change; they are what they are. A nexus which (i) enjoys social order, and (ii) is analysable into strands of enduring objects may be termed a 'corpuscular society.'

4. P.36, it can be said that each part is a system of all things, and i’ll explain why.

Each atom is a system of all things. 

5. P.41, Creative differentiation is a given of the actual world, not negotiable so accepting it’s importance is paramount for effective, compassionate integration.
All actual entities in the actual world, relatively to a given actual entity as 'subject,' are necessarily 'felt' by that subject, though in general vaguely. An actual entity as felt is said to be 'objectified' for that subject. Only a selection of eternal objects are 'felt' by a given subject, and these eternal objects are then said to have 'ingression' in that subject. But those eternal objects which are not felt are not therefore negligible. For each negative prehension has its own subjective form, however trivial and faint. 
It adds to the emotional complex, though not to the objective data. The emotional complex is the subjective form of the final 'satisfaction.' The importance of negative prehensions arises from the fact, that (i) actual entities form a system, in the sense of entering into each other's constitutions, (ii) that by the ontological principle every entity is felt by some actual entity, (iii) that, as a consequence of (i) and (ii), every entity in the actual world of a concrescent actuality has some gradation of real relevance to that concrescence, (iv) that, in consequence of (iii), the negative prehension of an entity is a positive fact with its emotional subjective form,t (v) there is a mutual sensitivity of the subjective forms of prehensions, so that they are not different to each other, (vi) the concrescence issues in one concrete feeling, the satisfaction. 
Emotional complex, i don't know what that is		
6. P.42, Whitehead owns to his own exclusions, he did so from the very beginning.
That we fail to find in experience any elements intrinsically incapable of exhibition as examples of general theory is the hope of rationalism. This hope is not a metaphysical premise. it is the faith which forms the motive for the pursuit of all sciences alike, including metaphysics.
In so far as metaphysics enables us to apprehend the rationality of things, the claim is justified. It is always open to us, having regard to the imperfections of all metaphysical systems, to lose hope at the exact point where we find ourselves.  

 		 	 	 		
			
				
					
The preservation of such faith must depend on an ultimate moral intuition into the nature of intellectual action-that it should embody the adventure of hope. Such an intuition marks the point where metaphysics-and indeed every science-gains assurance from religion and passes over into religion. But in itself the faith does not embody a premise from which the theory starts; it is an ideal which is seeking faction. In so far as we believe that doctrine, we are rationalists.
There must, however, be limits to the claim that all the elements in the universe are explicable by 'theory.' For 'theory' itself requires that there be elements so as to form the material for theorizing. 
A bridge can be drawn to the theory of IFS which is a system developed from clients with an undeniable given quality as how they present themselves as embodying the decision all the time, however obscured the decision might be presentes or feel to the subjective aim. This is why IFS is relevant, because it is born out of sensitivity and compassion to what life gives. And what gives is the starting point of self reconciliation, understanding what was given is no easy task, for the parts that constitute our nexus have different level of understanding, different agendas, contrasting philosophies, inertia, and a select attention or intensive relevance which obeys no time-space agreement, and just is. (quote trauma informed IFS therapy) and bridge to Presentational Immediacy 
7. P.43 Stubborn fact, concreteness is where it is, not where it should be, where it is.
The ontological principle asserts the relativity of decision; whereby every decision expresses the relation of the actual thing, for which a decision is made, to an actual thing by which that decision is made. But ‘decision’  cannot be construed as a casual adjunct of an actual entity. It constitutes the very meaning of actuality. An actual entity arises from decisions for it, and by its very existence provides decisions for other actual entities which supersede it.
The what happened on our why happened, that is the decision made for the actual occasion, what is also referred as…

… so 'decision' is the additional meaning imported by the word 'actual' into the phrase 'actual entity.' 'Actuality' is the decision amid 'potentiality.' It represents stubborn fact which cannot be evaded. 
…Stubborn fact will always be, no matter what, and our systems can’t always cope with this fact, which is the reason why a whole protector configuration might be deployed within the enduring society of occasions that constitute us. Feelings are stubborn, as once they are felt they become objectively immortal, be it upon reflection or for other persons to build upon. 



8. P.44 The superject as enjoying and becoming the decision, “decision by embodiment” is a constituent negative prehension that CAN be positively prehended.

Further, in the complete particular 'givenness' for an actual entity there is an element of exclusiveness. The various primary data and the concrescent feelings do not form a mere multiplicity. Their synthesis in the final unity of one actual entity is another fact of 'givenness.' The actual entity terminates its becoming in one complex feeling involving a completely determinate bond with every item in the universe, the bond being either a positive or a negative prehension. This termination is the 'satisfaction' of the actual entity.					
Thus the addition of another component alters this synthetic 'givenness.' Any additional component is therefore contrary to this integral 'givenness' of the original. This principle may be illustrated by our visual perception of a picture. The pattern of colours is 'given' for us. 
But an extra patch of red does not constitute a mere addition; it alters the whole balance. Thus in an actual entity the balanced unity of the total 'givenness' excludes anything that is not given. 		
This is the doctrine of the emergent unity of the superject. An actual entity is to be conceived both as a subject presiding over its own immediacy of becoming, and a superject which is the atomic creature exercising its function of objective immortality. It has become a 'being'; and it belongs to the nature of every 'being' that it is a potential for every 'becoming.'
This doctrine, that the final 'satisfaction' of an actual entity is intolerant of any addition, expresses the fact that every actual entity-since it is what it is-is finally its own reason for what it omits. In the real internal constitution of an actual entity there is always some element which is con- trary to an omitted element. Here 'contrary' means the impossibility of joint entry in the same sense. In other words, indetermination has evap- orated from 'satisfaction,' so that there is a complete determination of 'feeling,' or of 'negation of feeling,' respecting the universe. This evapora- tion of indetermination is merely another way of considering the process whereby the actual entity arises from its data. Thus, in another sense, each actual entity includes the uni- [72] verse, by reason of its determinate atti- tude towards every element in the universe. 

9. selected flux
The peculiarity of the course of history illustrates the joint relevance of the <ontological principle' and of this categoreal obligation. The evolution of history can be rationalized by the consideration of the determination of successors by antecedents. But, on the other hand, the evolution of tory is incapable of rationalization because it exhibits a selected flux of participating forms. No reason, internal to history, can be assigned why that flux of forms, rather than another flux, should have been illustrated. It is true that any flux must exhibit the character of internal
 tion. So much follows from the ontological principle.  		 	 	 		
			
The actual flux presents itself with the character of being merely <given.' It does not disclose any peculiar character of <perfection.' On the contrary, the imperfection of the world is the theme of every religion which offers a way of escape, and of every sceptic who deplores the prevailing superstition. 
		 	 	 		
			
10. confirmation of the final decision and it’s implications
“Further, in the case of those actualities whose immediate experience is most completely open to us, namely, human beings, the final decision of the immediate subject-superject, constituting the ultimate modification of subjective aim, is the foundation of our experience of responsibility, of approbation or of disapprobation, of self-approval or of self-reproach, of free-dom, of emphasis. This element in experience is too large to be put aside merely as misconstruction. It governs the whole tone of human life. 
It can be illustrated by striking [75] instances from fact or from fiction. But these instances are only conspicuous illustrations of human experience during each hour and each minute. The ultimate freedom of things, lying beyond all determinations, was whispered by Galileo-E pur si muove- freedom for the inquisitors to think wrongly, for Galileo to think rightly, and for the world to move in despite of Galileo and inquisitors. “


“The doctrine is, that each concrescence is to be referred to a definite free initiation and a definite free conclusion. The initial fact is macrocosmic, in the sense of having equal relevance to all occasions; the final fact is micro- cosmic, in the sense of being peculiar to that occasion. Neither fact is capable of rationalization, in the sense of tracing the antecedents which determine it. The initial fact is the primordial appetition, and the final fact is the decision of emphasis, finally creative of the ‘satisfaction.'.”

“We find ourselves in a buzzing  world, amid a democracy of fellow creatures; “

that same democracy exists within, through objective immortality. Kind of like in machine learning and reinforcement, trauma is the teacher for good or for bad.
				
		 	 	 		
11. Prehensions are transactional field, moment by moment these inner prehensions provide our becoming		
 The <prehension' of one actual entity by another actual entity is the complete transaction, analysable into the objectification of the former entity as one of the data for the latter, and into the fully clothed feeling wherebyithe datum is absorbed into the subjective satisfaction-<clothed' with the various elements of its <subjective form.' But this definition can be stated more generally so as to include the case of the prehension of an eternal object by an actual entity; namely, The <positive prehension' of an entity by an actual entity is the complete transaction analysable into the ingression, or objectification, of that entity as a datum for feeling, and into the feeling whereby this datum is absorbed into the subjective satis- faction. 
		 	 	 		
12. Parts and subjective aim dance within experience whether they are conscious of it or not, that is another whole dance which is not necessary for becoming, becoming will happen with or without are awarenes as confirmed by the principle of objective immortality. How and whether we prehend certain objects of experience is up to each wandering occassion.
	
				
					
						
The principle that I am adopting is that consciousness presupposes ex- perience, and not experience consciousness. It is a special element in the subjective forms of some feelings. Thus an actual entity may, or may not, be conscious of some part of its experience. Its experience is its complete formal constitution, including its consciousness, if any. 
					
				
			
		

13. Vector character a bit like stubborn fact, rather accompanies stubborn fact		
"The mind, being ... furnished with a great number of the simple ideas conveyed in by the senses, as they are found in exterior things, ..." Here the last phrase, 'as they are found in exterior things,' asserted what later I shall call the vector character of the primary feelings. 
				
14. p. 55 Mutal comtemporanity grounding can be overriden by exiles which dont affect the mutal contemporainity fundamentally but take a person for all functional purposes “out” of it
Each exterior thing is either one actual entity, or (more frequently) is a nexus of actual entities with imme- diacies mutually contemporary. 

		 	 	 		
			
				
15. p. 56 This is the conformation of an eco-self through that eco-self historic route, which might be more malleable at the start but endures through time as an evolving organism, a live concrescense meaning that it is in the “midst of it”, open to it and affected by it.					
any likeness between the successive occasions of at historic route procures a corresponding identity between their contributions to the datum of any subsequent actual entity; and it therefore secures a corresponding intensification in the imposition of conformity. 
…In particular each historic route of like occasions tends to prolong itself, by reason of the weight of uniform inheritance derivable from its members. The philosophy of organism abolishes the detached mind. Mental activity is one of the modes of feeling belonging to all actual entities in some degree, but only amounting to conscious intellectuality in some actual entities. 
				
16. The Doctrine of prehensions is the same as the eco-self, and the misconception of us as an individual substance.				
The perceptive constitution of the actual entity presents the problem, How can the other actual entities, each with its own formal existence, also objectively into the perceptive constitution of the actual entity in question? This is the problem of the solidarity of the universe. The classical doctrines of universals and particulars, of subject and predicate, of individ- ual substances not present in other individual substances, of [89] the exter- nality of relations, alike render this problem incapable of solution. The answer given by the organic philosophy is the doctrine of prehensions, in- volved in concrescent integrations, and terminating in a definite, complex unity of feeling. To be actual must mean that all actual things are alike ob- jects, enjoying objective immortality in fashioning creative actions; and that all actual things are subjects, each prehending the universe from which 	it arises. The creative action is the universe always becoming one in a par- ticular unity of self-experience, and thereby adding to the multiplicity which is the universe as many. This insistent concrescence into unity is the outcome of the ultimate self-identity of each entity. No entity-be it 'universal' or 'particular'-can play disjoined roles. Self-identity requires that every entity have one conjoined, self-consistent function, whatever be the complexity of that function. 

17. change is the description of the adventures of eternal objects, combined with witnessing of previous descriptioons by exiles and reintegration of the subjective aim change is acheived through full integration of certain excluded aspects of experience. Most of the time excuded out of protective and resilient nature: the fungal nature as an axis for resilience, healing is another wholeworld.		
			
				
					
						
Every actual entity is what it is, and is with its definite status in the universe, determined by its internal relations to other actual entities. 'Change' is the description of the adventures of eternal objects in the evolving universe of actual things. 


18. Parts and their misapprehensions			
It cannot be too clearly understood that some chief notions of European thought were framed under the influence of a misapprehension, only par- tially corrected by the scientific progress of the last century. This mistake consists in the confusion of mere potentiality with actuality. Continuity concerns what is potential; whereas actuality is incurably atomic. 

		 	 	 		
			
				
19. Paving the way for the doctrine of objectification, parts are sensible to this.					
This limitation of the way in which the contemporary actual entities are relevant to the 'formal' existence of the subject in question is the first example of the general [97] principle, that objectification relegates into ir- relevance, or into a subordinate relevance, the full constitution of the ob- jectified entity. Some real component in the objectified entity assumes the role of being how that particular entit in the experience of the subject. In this case, the objectified contemporaries are only directly rele- vant to the subject in their character of arising from a datum which is an extensive continuum. 

20. Paving the way for the falacy of presentational immediacy, when inference trumps perception.
Our direct perception, via our senses, of an immediate extensive shape, in a certain geometrical perspective to ourselves, and in certain general geometrical relations to the contemporary world, remains an ultimate fact. Our inferences are at fault. 

		 	 	 		
			
21. the ego (that i will refer to as subjective aim) is always different, id say that the subjective aim is constant and which embodies that subjective aim is what chnages.		
in the quotation from the second Meditation: "I am, I exist, is nec- essarily true each time that I pronounce it, or that I mentally conceive it,"t Descartes adopts the position that an act of experience is the primary type of actual occasion. But in his subsequent developments he assumes that his mental substances endure change. Here he goes beyond his argument. For each time he pronounces 'I am, I exist,' the actual occasion, which is the ego, is different; and the 'he' which is common to the two egos is an eternal object or, alternatively, the nexus of successive occasions. Also in the quotation from the first [117J Meditation he begins by appealing to an act of experience-"I am here, seated by the fire...." He then associates this act of experience with his body-"these hands and body are mine." He then finally appeals for some final notion of actual entities in the remarkable sentence: "And for the same reason, although these general things, to wit, [a body], eyes, a head, hands, and such like, may be imaginary, we are bound at the same time to confess that there are at least some other objects yet more simple and more universal, which are real and true; and of these ... all these images of things which dwell in our thoughts, whether true and real.or false and fantastic, are formed." 

22. body first and ideally universe later				

these hands and feet are mine." In the philosophy of organism this immediate association is the recognition of them as distinguishable data whose formal constitutions are immediately felt in the origination of experience. In this function the animal body does not differ in principle from the rest of the past actual world; but it does differ in an intimacy of association by reason of which its spatial and temporal connections obtain some definition in the ex- perience of the subject. What is vague for the rest of the world has ob- tained some additional measure of distinctness for the bodily organs. But, in principle, it would be equally true to say, tThe actual world is mine.' 
23. Each part is always in born a-new			
Newton, in his treatment of space, transforms potentiality into actual fact, that is to say, into a creature, instead of a datum for creatures. According to the philosophy of organism, the extensive space-time continuum is the fundamental aspect of the limitation laid upon abstract potentiality by the actual world. 
A more complete rendering of this limited, 'real' potentiality is the 'physical field.' A new creation has to arise from the actual world as much as from pure potentiality: it arises from the total universe and not solely from its mere abstract elements. It also adds to that universe. 

		 	 	 		

23. Order in a person’s FS is concerned with the gradations of intensity in the satisfacions of actual entities. Cognitive light-cones of each part.
(i) That 'order' in the actual world is differentiated from mere 'givenness' by introduction of adaptation for the attainment of an end. (ii) That is concerned with the gradations of intensity in the satisfactions of actual entities (members of the nexus) in whose formal constitutions the nexus [128] (i.e., antecedent members of the nexus) in question is objectified.
(iii) That the heightening of intensity arises from order such that the multiplicity of components in the nexus can enter explicit feeling as con- trasts, and are not dismissed into negative prehensions as incompatibilities. 
(iv) That 'intensity' in the formal constitution of a subject-superject involves in its objective functioning as superject. 'Order' is a mere generic term: there can only be some definite specific 'order,' not merely 'order' in the vague. Thus every definite total phase of 'givenness' involves a reference to that specific 'order' which is its dominant ideal, and involves the specific 'disorder' due to its inclusion of 'given' components which exclude the attainment of the full ideal. The attain- ment is partial, and thus there is 'disorder'; but there is some attainment and thus there is some 'order.' There is not just one ideal 'order' which all actual entities should attain and fail to attain. In each case there is an ideal peculiar to each particular actual entity, and arising from the domi- nant components in its phase of 'givenness.' This notion of 'dominance' will have to be discussed later in connection with the notion of the sys- tematic character of a 'cosmic epoch' and of the subordinate systematic characters of 'societies' included in a cosmic epoch. 
					

VERY VERY IMPORTANT - 			
Thus the notion of 'order' is bound up with the notion of an actual entity as involving an attainment which is a specific satisfaction. This satis- faction is the attainment of something individual to the entity in question. It cannot be construed as a component contributing to its own concres- cence; it is the ultimate fact, individual to the entity. The notion of 'satis- faction' is the notion of the 'entity as concrete' abstracted from the 'process of concrescence'; it is the outcome separated from the process, thereby losing the actuality of the atomic entity, which is both process and outcome.


						
'Satisfaction' provides the individual element in the composition of the actual entity-that element which has led to the definition of substance as ‘requiring nothing but itself in order to exist.’ but the ‘satisfaction’ is the ‘superject’ rather than the substance or the subject. It closes up the entity; and yet is the superject adding its character to the creativity whereby there is a becoming of entities superseding the one in question. The 'formal' reality of the actuality in question belongs to its process of concrescence and not to its 'satisfaction.' This is the sense in which the philosophy of organism interprets Plato's phrase 'and never really is'; for the superject can only be interpreted in terms of its 'objective immortality.'
			


			
'Satisfaction' is a generic term: there are specific differences between the 'satisfactions' of different entities, including gradations of intensity. These specific differences can only be expressed by the analysis of the com- ponents in the concrescence out of which the actual entity arises. The in- tensity of satisfaction is promoted by the 'order' in the phases from which concrescence arises and through which it passes; it is enfeebled by the [130] 'disorder.' The components in the concrescence are thus 'values' contributory to the 'satisfaction.' The concrescence is thus the building up of a determinate 'satisfaction,' which constitutes the completion of the actual togetherness of the discrete components. The process of concres- cence terminates with the attainment of a fuIIy determinate 'satisfaction'; and the creativity thereby passes over into the 'given' primary phase for the concrescence of other actual entities. This transcendence is thereby estab- lished when there is attainment of determinate 'satisfaction' completing the antecedent entity. Completion is the perishing of immediacy: 'It never reaIIy is.' 		

			 	 	 		
			
				
					
In other words, the 'satisfaction' of an entity can only be discussed in terms of the usefulness of that entity. It is a qualification of creativity. The tone of feeling embodied in this satisfac- tion passes into the world beyond, by reason of these -objectifications. The world is self-creative; and the actual entity as self-creating creature passes into its immortal function of part-creator of the transcendent world. In its self-creation the actual entity is guided by its ideal of itself as individual satisfaction and as transcendent creator. The enjoyment of this ideal is the ‘subjective aim,’ by reason of which the actual entity is a determinate process.
		 	 	 		
			
				
					
The concrescence, absorbing the derived data into immediate privacy, consists in mating the data with ways of feeling provocative of the private synthesis. These subjective ways of feeling are not merely receptive of the data as alien facts; they clothe the dry bones with the flesh of a real being, emotional, purposive, appreciative.
