        In Whitehead's metaphysics, God has two natures: primordial and
        consequent. The primordial nature is the conceptual valuation of
        all eternal objects, providing the initial aim for each occasion.
        This is the lure toward optimal satisfaction given the actual world.

        God does not determine outcomes but offers possibilities. Each
        occasion is free to modify its initial aim through self-determination.
        God persuades, not coerces - respect for creaturely autonomy is
        fundamental.

        The consequent nature is God's physical prehension of all actual
        occasions as they achieve satisfaction. God feels the world's joys
        and sufferings, preserving all experience with tender care. Nothing
        is lost from the divine perspective.

        For trauma-informed work, this offers a metaphysics of hope: there
        is always a lure toward healing, toward greater wholeness. The
        initial aim toward SELF-energy is never absent, even when obscured
        by protective parts. Therapy is removing obstacles to the lure.
