The Sequence of Hexagrams - Dialectical Unfolding

        The 64 hexagrams are not random but follow a meaningful sequence
        representing the dialectical unfolding of situations:

        1-2: Creative and Receptive (fundamental polarity)
        3-4: Difficulty at Beginning and Youthful Folly (birth struggles)
        5-6: Waiting and Conflict (patience and tension)
        7-8: Army and Holding Together (collective organization)
        ...
        63-64: After Completion and Before Completion (endless process)

        Key insight for DAE-GOV: Every organizational pattern has:
        - A natural arising (when conditions align)
        - An internal dynamic (tendency toward transformation)
        - A successor state (what it naturally becomes)

        Burnout Spiral (hexagram-like pattern):
        - Arises from: Toxic Productivity (unsustainable yang)
        - Internal dynamic: Exhaustion accumulates (yin emerges)
        - Transforms into: Either Dorsal Shutdown OR Sustainable Rhythm
        - Which outcome depends on: Witnessing, SELF-energy, boundaries

        The I Ching teaches: Understand the pattern's inherent trajectory,
        then work with the flow to guide toward healing transformation.
