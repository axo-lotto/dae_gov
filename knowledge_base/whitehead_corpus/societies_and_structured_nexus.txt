        A society is a nexus of actual occasions with a common defining
        characteristic that is inherited through a chain of prehensions.
        The society endures through time by reproducing its pattern in
        successor occasions.

        Societies can be structured, with subsocieties and hierarchies of
        order. A living organism is a highly structured society with a
        dominant occasion (the soul) that unifies the experience of the
        whole. Lower-level societies (cells, organs) contribute to but are
        subordinate to the dominant occasion.

        The environment of a society provides the conditions for its
        endurance. If the environment changes radically, the society may
        lose its defining characteristic and dissolve. This is the fragility
        of order: it depends on supportive conditions.

        Yet societies also exhibit creativity. Novel patterns can emerge
        within a structured nexus, leading to evolution, adaptation, learning.
        The interplay of order and novelty is the heartbeat of process.
