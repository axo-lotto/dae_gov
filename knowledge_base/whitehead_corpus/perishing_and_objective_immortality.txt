        Each occasion perishes immediately upon achieving satisfaction.
        Its subjective immediacy is lost forever - it is no longer
        experiencing itself as subject. This is the pathos of existence:
        all moments fade.

        Yet perishing is not annihilation. The occasion gains objective
        immortality, becoming a datum for all future occasions. It is
        prehended, felt, included in subsequent becomings. The past lives
        on through its effects.

        This is a middle path between eternalism (nothing changes) and
        nihilism (nothing matters). Each moment is genuinely new yet
        conditioned by all that came before. The present inherits the
        past and bequeaths itself to the future.

        In organizational trauma work, this validates both loss and
        continuity. What was painful cannot be undone - it happened and
        its effects persist. But new moments can relate to that past
        differently, transforming its meaning through fresh prehension.
        Healing does not erase but integrates.
