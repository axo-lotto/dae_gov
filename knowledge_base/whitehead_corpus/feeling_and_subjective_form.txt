        Every prehension consists of three factors: the subject, the datum,
        and the subjective form. The subjective form is how the subject feels
        the datum - not merely that it prehends, but how it prehends.

        Subjective form includes emotional tone, intensity, valuation, purpose.
        It is not a passive reception but an active qualification of experience.
        The same datum can be prehended with different subjective forms by
        different occasions, yielding different outcomes.

        The subjective aim is the lure toward a specific form of satisfaction.
        It guides concrescence, determining which prehensions are positively
        valued and which are negatively prehended (excluded). The aim is both
        given (from God's primordial nature) and chosen (through the occasion's
        self-determination).

        This is the root of freedom in process philosophy: each occasion
        synthesizes its past creatively, guided by but not determined by
        its subjective aim. There is both receptivity (from the past) and
        self-creation (toward novelty).
