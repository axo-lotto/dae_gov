        Each hexagram (six lines) represents a specific situation.
        But hexagrams are not static - they transform through changing lines.

        A changing line (老陽 old yang or 老陰 old yin) indicates:
        - A force at maximum intensity, about to reverse
        - A point of transformation, a bifurcation edge

        Example: Hexagram 01 (☰☰ Qian, pure yang) with changing first line
        transforms into Hexagram 44 (☰☴ Gou, coming to meet).

        This models phase transitions in complex systems:
        - A force at extreme becomes unstable
        - Small perturbation triggers qualitative shift
        - New pattern emerges from transformation

        In epoch learning:
        - Organism at convergence edge (Kairos moment)
        - BAGUA modulation active (high edge intensity)
        - Transformation guided by lure toward satisfaction
        - New pattern crystallizes (satisfaction achieved)

        The I Ching wisdom: Recognize the moment of change,
        align with the transformation instead of resisting it.
