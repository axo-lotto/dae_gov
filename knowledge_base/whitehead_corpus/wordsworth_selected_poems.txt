                   WOEDS WORTH — THE MAN.
   Wordsworth was               constitutionally averse          to giving in

distinct form, or with any detail, the story of his life.                    He
was the last man to write an autobiography                 ;    as he himself

expresses it   :
                   —
                   "lam not one who much or oft delights
                    In personal talk."


   And yet, much of the life of this great poet, his mental
and spiritual aspirations, and the wide range of his studies,
are chronicled in his poems.               They picture his surround-
ings, the atmosphere in which             he lived, the episodes of his
career, the crises        through which he passed.               No poet re-
flects his   environment so completely as does Wordsworth.
   It is   an easy task to       set forth the salient events in his

life,   but to reproduce him as he was, to look upon the
man himself,         is   difficult.   In our    effort    to    find   a   true
portraiture of         his personal      appearance,      we must depend
upon the descriptive powers of his friends.
   Thomas De Quincey, who was                   his   neighbor at Gras-
mere for a quarter of a century, informs us that Words-
worth was somewhat above medium height, of indifferent
figure,    with "narrow and drooping shoulders."
8                                INTRODUCTION.

    His face was meditative, but full of force.                           Its central

feature was the eyes.                  " I    have seen them assume an ap-
pearance the most solemn and spiritual that it is possible
for the       human eye to wear," said De Quincey.
    Leigh Hunt, another friend and companion of Words-
worth,        bears        similar     testimony:       "I never beheld eyes
that looked so inspired, so supernatural.                             One might im-
agine Ezekiel or Isaiah to have had such                               eyes."       They
were     gray in color, sympathetic, penetrating.                              His was
"the eye that was in itself a soul."
    Among the wooded hills of Cumberland, at Cockermouth
on the Derwent, April                   7,    1770, these eyes         first   saw the
light.        It   was the year that Hegel, the philosopher                     ;   John
Foster,       the preacher;            George Canning, the orator; and
Thorwaldsen, the sculptor, were born.                            It    was the year
that     Goldsmith's "Deserted Village" was published; in
American history, the year of the " Boston Massacre."
    John Wordsworth, the                      poet's   father,   was     attorney-at-

law     and        legal    agent of         Sir   James Lowther, afterward
first    Earl of Lonsdale.               His mother was Anne Cookson,
daughter of a mercer in Penrith.                         William was the sec-
ond of         five    children.        His mother died when                   he was
eight years           old;    his father,          when he was thirteen.             At
the age of eight he was sent to a school at Hawkshead,
Lancashire.           Here he spent nine years "among a people
of simple          habits,    and scenery of a sweet and pastoral
dignity."           During      this    susceptible      period        he formed a
close friendship with the mountains, the valleys, the lakes,

and the rivers of his native district.                      Here the deep pas-
sion     of    his    devotion to the beautiful in nature began to
                             INTRODUCTION.                              9


appear.       As   lie   tells   us in the    "Prelude," his favorite
amusements were hunting, fishing, boating, skating.                   He
enjoyed long walks among the hills and about the lakes.
He knew the people among whom he lived                 ;   learned their
ways    ;   felt their   common losses and pleasures        ;   noted the
habits of the domestic animals           ;   watched with eager       de-

light the flight of the birds.

  His surroundings induced a receptive attitude of mind,
and an insight into life at its uniform level which breaks
out    so    spontaneously into poetic song.          It is here     that
he learned that "homely humanity" which gives such
artlessness     and genuineness to his poems.
  In the year 1787, when the poet was seventeen, he entered
St.   John's College, Cambridge.             In point of numbers and
scholarly attainment, it ranked second among the colleges of
the University.          His career as a student was not a distin-
guished one.        He chafed under official restraint and devel-
oped that " stiff, moody, and violent temper " of which he
speaks and which his mother had noted in his childhood.
Failing to adapt himself to the coercive curriculum of the
college, he outlined a course of study for himself.

  Wordsworth observed carefully the movements of his own
mind.       His intellectual powers expanded under the impulse
of his own will.         While at the University he read largely
the great masters of English,          — Chaucer, Spenser, Milton,
Shakespeare.
  Upon graduation (1791) he spent a year in France.                    It

was the period of the French Revolution.              He threw him-
self into its exciting scenes        with all the enthusiasm of his
chivalrous nature.          Thus   far he    had been accustomed to

the quietude of a rural and intellectual environment;          now
he touched the beating heart of a nation in the throes of
a great upheaval.      He was by nature patriot as well as
poet, and he embraced the radical views of republican inde-

pendence.     These he expressed boldly, but in after life in
modified form.
  In 1792 Wordsworth returned to England.            Some of his
friends hoped he would enter the priesthood of the church,

but for this calling he claimed no aptitude.         He had one
purpose, one absorbing ambition,   —   literature.   His earliest
poems, entitled "Descriptive Sketches" and           "The Even-
ing Walk," he published in 1793.       He took this step, as he
himself says, " with great reluctance," and to show that he
"could do something."
     At this time he projected the scheme of issuing a monthly
"Miscellany," which should contain "critical remarks on
poetry, the arts, painting, gardening,     etc.,   besides essays

on morals and politics."     A ponderous undertaking!          The
scheme failed.      A bequest of £900 from Eaisley Calvert,
who urged him to make poetry his life work, came as an
opportune stroke of good fortune and made a            life   solely

given to literature a tangible reality.     A few years later,
the heirs to the estate of    Lord Lonsdale, who owed the
poet's father a goodly    sum for professional services, paid
the entire amount, including interest.    With this sum in
hand, Wordsworth could give himself more freely to his
favorite pursuit. As Lowell observes, "the timely help
which he received made it honest for him to write poems
that will never die, instead of theatrical critiques as ephem-
eral as play-bills, or leaders that led only to oblivion."
                              INTRODUCTION.                                  11

      The literary life of Wordsworth is gracefully interwoven
with that of his sister Dorothy, who was his congenial com-
panion for many years.            The manual effort of writing was
irksome to the poet       ;   but his sister was a most sympathetic
and painstaking amanuensis.            She was devotion itself         ;    her
life and that of the poet were of one fabric.               All visitors at
Wordsworth's home agree in praising its abounding intel-
lectual life.    De Quincey is among those who have extolled
it.     He describes the poet's sister as of " warm, even ardent
manner," with an eye open to               all       that   was engaging,
quickly responding to the beautiful in nature and                           art,

quick to note all the poet said or quoted, " consumed by a
subtle tire of impassioned intellect."           Mr. J. C. Shairp, writ-
ing of her, says that she was "so little of a literary lady,
so entirely       removed from being a blue-stocking, that she
was ignorant of many books and subjects which, to most
educated persons, were quite commonplace. ...                     It was she

who maintained for him a saving intercourse w ith his true    T




self,   opened for him the obstructed passage between head
and heart, whence in time came genuine self-knowledge and
peace.      She    it   was who softened and humanized him,
opened his eyes to the more hidden beauties, his heart to
the gentler affections."
      These two kindred minds formed that sweet domestic
felicity   which led Coleridge to say, " This is the happiest
family I ever saw."           In his home life, Wordsworth realized
his own sentiment, " so much of earth, so much of heaven."

laid at the poet's feet.            No words can express more exqui-
sitely than his own his appreciation of her fidelity                         :
                                                                                 —

                       And humble cares and delicate fears,
                       A heart, the fountain of sweet tears,
                       And love, and faith, and joy.     11




  In 1795 the two Wordsworths settled at Kacedown, Dor-
setshire, in Southern England, where they remained for two

years.      The poet lived in           seclusion.       He began his work
in a half-hearted way, waiting, as it were, for the complete

control of his Muse.              His imperfect poetical productions
show a distrustful, a semi-industrious spirit.                           This unnat-
ural epoch in his career speedily                came to an end through
a visit from Coleridge, who had seen in Wordsworth's ear-
liest    poems a prophecy of that "original poetic genius"
which afterward so completely fascinated English readers.
  The presence             of   Coleridge     at     Eacedown marks the
beginning        of    Wordsworth's fame as                   an    English           poet.
In his struggles           to   find   a   way     out    of       the    entangling
mazes of his introspection, Coleridge was his guide, his
new genius, his better self.               Wordsworth read to him his
story of the          ruined cottage, afterward incorporated into
the     first   book of the "Excursion."                 It    charmed his ad-
miring visitor, who declared it had                  " a character by books

not     hitherto      reflected."      His judicious praise gave new
courage to the disheartened poet.                     As       a    result       of    the
new companionship, Wordsworth                      (1798)      issued "Lyrical
Ballads," containing twenty-three                  poems,          the   first    being
Coleridge's        "Ancient       Mariner."        The        remaining          poems
were from the pen of Wordsworth.
                              INTRODUCTION.                                    13

     After a year's absence in Germany, William and Doro-
thy Wordsworth settled at Grasmere, in Westmoreland.
No region could be more congenial                  to    the     poet,   for   it

was    near the place where he was born, and which he so
fondly       loved.   While    living   there,    he     was     married       to

Mary Hutchinson, a former               pupil.     Of    their    union, live
children      were born, of      whom      three       died    young.      The
personal       virtues   of   Wordsworth's        wife    are     written in
immortal verse, in the poem, " She was a Phantom of
Delight."
     In 1812 Wordsworth removed to Allan Bank, and in
1813 to Eydal         Mount     These places are near the charm-
ing English Lakes.             Here Coleridge and Southey were
frequent visitors and, with our poet, gave the                       name to
the    "Lake School of Poetry."           It     was the object of         this
coterie      of poets    to withstand     the formal and inflexible
mannerisms of the poetry of the day.                    Wordsworth, him-
self a populist of the best type,          maintained that the true
poet should set forth, in his poetic strains, the emotions
of    the popular heart.        His poetry should be a transcript
of    life   among the common people.             He should avoid the
stilted      phrases and the high-sounding metaphors of the
schools and       come down      to the dialect' of the            home and
the street.      Into this theory he threw himself with char-
acteristic impetuosity.         It is possible that        he went to too
great an extreme of literalness             in his      intense     desire to
popularize poetry, and yet he clad the homeliest scenes
of    domestic life with a certain native fascination that is
irresistible     to   the unprejudiced      reader.        He     chose    the
exact idioms of the people          ;   he translated homespun life
14                            INTRODUCTION.

into     homespun       phrase.     He dignified the common toil of
the toiler;       everyday occurrences, the most ordinary as-
pects     of nature,     were transfigured by his magic touch.
The simplicity          of   his    style     was    all   the more        striking
because     it    was   in   such      strong       contrast to         the studied
elaboration of the poetry of his time.
  The      conscientious      purpose of the "Lake Poets" was
misunderstood           by the      critics.        The Edinburgh Review
selected    Wordsworth           for    its    special     ridicule,      and pub-
lished a travesty on his style.                 No doubt this had much
to do with the diminution of the sale of his poems, but

the poet kej^t a sweet temper; he persevered;                             he wrote
and published.           He grew in breadth of                    poetic feeling
and knowledge of men; in sympathy with their needs;
in responsiveness to the               awakening of the universal soul.
No subject was too trivial for him;                      he was the prophet
of the     commonplace.             This kindliness of spirit toward
humanity was sure             to    triumph over the rancor of the
critic   and the cynic.
     The success of the " Lake School of Poets " was preemi-
nently Wordsworth's success.                   He attempted what at first
sight seemed the impossible,                — to produce a revolution in
poetry.     At the same time it was necessary to overcome
prejudice,       and to bring       his     readers into a favorable and
receptive        relationship with himself.                It    was a work of
education quite as           much as inspiration, but he conquered
all    prejudices and won an enviable place in the affections
of the people.

     It is not the purpose of this sketch to give in detail the

literary product         of the      fifty-two years            spent    among the
                              INTRODUCTION.                                 15

green hills of Westmoreland and by her sparkling waters.
The number          of   Wordsworth's poems runs far into the
hundreds.      We may note them in classification only.                 He
wrote ballads, narrative poems,            lyrics,   poems akin to the
antique    style,    odes,     sonnets,   and poems       reflective    and
elegiac.    Although he lacked a sense of humor, and strains
of pleasantry are absent           from his lines, he possessed the
art of interpreting life in a way that               no one has equaled
in his generation or in ours.

  We may picture the poet of the world's heart dwelling
among the      forests        and beside the lakes of his beloved
Grasmere.      His was the ideal life of the meditative poet,
a smooth and unvexed current of satisfied ambition.                     The
rural setting of his life's        work was in full accord with his
intellectual   and emotional nature, and yet he was not
wholly removed from the business of the world.                   In 1813
he was appointed Distributor of Stamps for the County
of Westmoreland, an office which he could fill largely by

deputy.      De Quincey speaks of the appointment                  as       an
instance of the remarkable good luck which waited upon
Wordsworth through his whole                life.    " In our view     it   is

only another illustration of that scripture which describes
the righteous as never forsaken," are the words of Lowell.
  Wordsworth received a pension                     of   £300 from      the
English government, this being the third time his fortune
was increased.           It   may be that De Quincey's observation
was not far from the truth.               Wordsworth's highest honor
came   in the year 1813,          when he was made poet laureate,
succeeding his friend Southey to that merited distinction.
   Wordsworth died at Rydal Mount, April 23, 1850,                 — the
16                              INTRODUCTION.

anniversary of the birth and the death of William Shake-
speare.          Wordsworth was buried                 in   the   churchyard   at

Grasmere.          Upon that enchanting region he has written
his   name in imperishable characters.                      Annually hundreds
of visitors pass in solemn meditation before the sacred spot

where lies his dust, and pause in respectful silence before
the plain marble slab bearing the poet's name.                         Near by
are the ivy-mantled church, the abrupt hill, the sparkling

waterfall, the quiet-flowing Eotha.                     It is the shrine of a

poet whose praises ages to come will continue to sing.



                   WORDSWORTH — THE POET.
     As some great painters have painted their own portraits,
so    some eminent writers have                 left    us sketches of them-
selves, their style, their place in literature.                   These autobio-
graphical touches have not always been modest, or free
from egotism; and many of them have given the author a
rank quite as high as he deserves.                     In contrast with these
poets, Wordsworth writes of himself with becoming re-
serve: "I yield to no one in love for my art. I therefore

labor    at it     with reverence,           affection,     and industry.      My
main endeavor as to style has been that my poems should
be written in pure, intelligible English."
     This   is    the   first   quality that impresses the reader of
Wordsworth's poems,              —   their    thorough workmanship.            He
never wearied of remodeling, reconstructing, and polishing
his verse.        He had a fixed standard of literary merit, and
labored unceasingly to bring each poem up to that standard.
Self-reliant as he was, confident of his true position in his
                                       INTRODUCTION.                                   17

relation to the reader, he always carried within himself such

deference for his subject, and such a strong desire to give
his thought adequate expression, that no poem was beneath

his conscientious effort.                    Poetry was, in his view, invested
with a sort of divine flavor                  ;   it   demanded the best that was
in him    ;   he could not profane it by an indifferent, an inex-
act, a languid style.

  "In Wordsworth were the very highest powers                                       of the

poetic mind."             Lowell, in thus speaking of our poet, did not
forget the four great masters of English verse that had pre-
ceded him,        — Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, and Milton.
As each of these writers was eminent in his sphere, so
Wordsworth was in his. Comparisons are futile; a just
estimate is essential. The opinion of some of our best
judges is that Wordsworth is the fifth in the order of Eng-
lish poets.           In him were the true qualities of poetic                       senti-

ment, and in him flowed the deep currents of poetic feeling.
  He protested against all the factitious devices which
buttressed life about him.                        It was an era of     which Carlyle
said,    "Our age               is    mechanical."         Against this tendency
Wordsworth entered his plea for contemplation.                                He called
a halt in the rushing tide of business and bade                 men think
to be as      well as       to do.          He would do away with much of
the apparatus, the                     useless     furniture     of   life,   its   costly
trappings, its artificial paraphernalia.                          He had a deep-
felt    philosophy of                life   which he sought to impress upon
his age       :   man      is        deathless, his      being   is   super-mundane.
Into his magnificent Ode, instinct with immortality, our
poet has compressed the sublime realities of the origin of
human life        :

             '
                 '   Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting
                     The soul that rises with us, our life star,
                         Hath had elsewhere its setting,
                         And cometh from afar.
                         Not in entire forgetfulness,
                         And not in utter nakedness,
                     But trailing clouds of glory do we come
                         From God, who is our home
                     Heaven lies about us in our infancy."

     Wordsworth was a true poet of nature.                  " I, a Worshiper

of Nature," lie exclaims, not in sentimentality but in strict-

ness of faith in the natural and in the supernatural.                        He
believed in " Nature's self," which is " the breath of                     God,"
or, as   Goethe expresses it, "nature, the living garment of
the Deity."
     The extraordinary hold Wordsworth had upon the entire
century to which he belonged is due to his marvelous power
to interpret nature.             All the strings of this aeolian harp

vibrate with           life   as the   breezes of nature play through

them.     The current of his feeling runs deep.                    The purest
in nature, that which seems to be hidden from the ordinary

beholder, he sees with soul-eyes.                 Some of his poems are
outbursts of song as he greets some messenger from the
sky.     " 0, blithe newcomer," he sings, and again                :
                                                                       —
            " Ethereal minstrel; pilgrim of the sky         !




                 Dost thou despise the earth where care abounds?"

     All poems of address are, in their initial words, an uplift-
ing, passionate           admiration for the chaste in nature's holy
 realm, the songful, the gayly attired, the modest, the free.
 His penetrating eye detects action where we see languor
 brilliant color where we see only a blank.

  Wordsworth clothed with sacredness the common things
of life.    The earth is not a cold clod, but                 —
                      " Mother earth, her mirth, her tears,
                              Her humblest mirth and tears,"

are lyric    personalities to his              open   soul.     He diffuses his
being through every avenue of nature.                         He makes a confi-
dant of the " fair river,"                " the green earth," " the misty

mountain."
                      '
                          '   Knowing that nature never did betray
                              The heart that loved her,"

he trusts her absolutely.               It is said that Wordsworth lacked

the sense of smell, but no one ever possessed a clearer per-
ception of the hidden perfume that was in the flower                     :
                                                                             —
                  " Flowers laugh before thee on their beds,
                   And fragrance in thy footing treads
                   Thou dost preserve the stars from wrong,
                   And the most ancient heavens, through thee,

   When the mantle of vision actually falls upon him, he

matter of his poem             ;   she seems to write his poem for him.
Wordsworth,             in    advanced      years,    commenting    on    his

early    life,       speaks of the hour when the consciousness of
the infinite variety of natural appearances, which had been
unnoticed by the poets of any age or country, first broke
upon him         :
                     " I made a resolution to supply, in some degree,

the deficiency."             That    resolution, fully carried out,      made
him our foremost poet of nature.                     The unity and consist-
ency of his poems, which are their chief characteristic, are
due to his living for a lifetime in fraternal intimacy with
nature.

  That which was within said                   to    that which   was with-
out,— to the great mass of mountains, the world of leaf
and blossom, — "we are friends, we are one." To the poet's
discerning           eye,    Helvellyn and Skiddaw, his companions
for nearly eight decades, were                 like    Hermon and     Tabor,

filled   with rejoicing.             The   secret of his    melodious song
was in his own soul, but its themes, its setting, its visible
shapes, abode in the rugged slope of the mountains, the
liquid flow of the river.              He was familiar with the chang-
ing phenomena of nature, with the full round of the sea-
sons, and all the pleasures and charms which each brings.

He was a part of the soil, the lakes, the fauna and flora, of
Westmoreland. He acted upon his own theory that " it is
essential for every poet that would peacefully possess his

faculty in these             modern    times, to associate himself with

some appropriate spot or tract of scenery, the whole influ-
ence of which he may thoroughly exhaust and incorporate
with his verse."
  Wordsworth's view of nature was broad and far-reaching.
                            INTRODUCTION.                             21

In the clear expanse of field, the placid stream, the pellucid
air, in   the bold outline of the mountain, he took exquisite
delight.      The " poet of the twilight," speaking from the
heart of nature to the heart of                   man, made his noblest
songs the media between the visible and the invisible,
the material and           the   spiritual.       He had    one   maxim
let    us seek truth   ;   let   us enter into the temple of truth
through the vestibule of nature.                   Wordsworth put    his

ear    down to the     earth and listened to the throbbings of
nature's heart.

   As typical of his relation to nature we may quote the
following representative lines            :
                                              —
                                     " For I have learned
              To look on nature, not as in the hour
              Of thoughtless youth, but hearing oftentimes
              The still, sad music of humanity,
              Nor harsh, nor grating, though of ample power
              To chasten and subdue. And I have felt
              A presence that disturbs me with the joy
              Of elevated thoughts    ;   a sense sublime
              Of something far more deeply interfused,
              Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns
              And the round ocean and the living air
              And the blue sky and in the mind of man.'"

   With all his poetic fancy, he was sometimes too realis-
tic,   writing with ludicrous, mathematical precision.              The
couplet, —
               "I've measured it from side to side,
                 'Tis three feet long and two feet wide,"


was so exact that he omitted it, but only at the solicitation
of friends.    It is, however, very Wordsworthian.
22                          INTRODUCTION.

  He was convinced that no poet can be great unless he
follows his      own bent.      This mental drift may, however,
become enslaving.          Wordsworth's desire for naturalness, at
times,    made      this   very naturalness            unnatural,          artificial,

and stilted.
  Wordsworth was           distinctively the poet of the                    spirit    of
man.      Man and nature were closely allied in his mind.
" Wordsworth is the poet of nature because he possesses

the kinship between nature and                  man by reason of their
common origin and          life in    God."      He regarded it as his
mission to show that         life is   pervaded with beauty, whose
heart beats with the rapture                 of the         Eternal.        Nothing
seems    lifeless   or valueless, for        in each         and every object
are the " Wisdom and Spirit of the Universe."                            As man
stands highest in the order of creation, so                           man is the
supreme passion of Wordsworth's pen.                           He      interpreted
nature not for its own sake, but for the sake of man, whose
every condition, circumstance, emotion, appealed to him.
The homely incidents of              rural    life,   — the child at play,
the woes of the afflicted, the merriment of the gay, the
pathos of the disappointed, the soldier on crutches, the
vagrant    beggar, the       tattered        cloak      of     a     poor     girl,    a
wooden bowl, a drum, a spade,                   —     all     find    in    him an
interpreter.

  Wordsworth took nothing second-hand.                               He was          the
poet of man, whose life he knew and whose lot he shared.
He sketched in their native dialects the actual experiences
through which men pass.     He sang them in such a way
as to reflect      them    as they are, not as they                  might be or
ought to     be.     He saw and combated not imaginary but
                             INTRODUCTION.                                     23

existent   evils.      His    intellectual     sanity was vitalized by
his     human sympathy.            He was        nobly      loyal        to   man
wherever he found him.             His patriotism was without the
alloy of personal ambition.             Among his choicest sonnets
are those dedicated to liberty.              They come from the quiet
walks of a recluse, but have been called the most perma-
nent record in English literature of the war with Napo-
leon.    In his youth Wordsworth partook of the highest
hopes of the great reformers for universal emancipation.
He lived to see all slaves in the British Colonies set free.
     His poems teach us that            in    provincial     minds are to
be    found   faculties      strongly    intellectual.        Beneath the
coarse corduroy there          breathes a true patriotism, a fine
sentiment.       By    his   genius     in    painting      life       about the
hearthstone      and   at    the   spinning wheel, our poet                   has
done much to enthrone manhood and womanhood, to abate
the unseemly rivalry for social rank.                   In Wordsworth's
view, the distinction of station based upon the accident
of birth, or the possession of wealth,             is    meretricious and
despicable.      Let the blood in human veins be the health-
ful red of sturdy thinking          and noble doing, and the man
is   at once a   member of the nobility.
     Wordsworth has been called a " lonely man                     ;   his life a

long soliloquy."       It is rather a long colloquy with nature

and man in their simplicity.            He looked out upon —

                                        "the fretful stir
              Unprofitable, and the fever of the world."


He knew its stress of competitive overwork, its strife, its
bitter heartburnings. He was a prophet of the work-a-day
24                            INTRODUCTION.

world.     It is   noticeable that as he grew older, a change
passed over him.         Sadness crept into his poetry        ;   not bald
pessimism, but a spiritless lament.                   This passing from
buoyancy to somberness was too speedily registered in his
poetry,    which fell off        in its true poetic flavor   and in its
hold upon the people.             Within    fifteen years (1798-1813)

his great work was done.            This is the period of his master-
pieces, although     from time to time after this he produced
a poem of great literary merit.
     The philosophic tastes, which Wordsworth possessed to
so fine a degree, appear repeatedly in his poems.                 His brain
was high-arched      ;   it   could compass great subjects.          With
an art that was masterful, he introduced into                     many of
his   poems some of the deepest philosophies of life.                 Some
of these philosophic unfoldings appear incidentally, and for

that reason are all the more effective.
     There are three poems which stand out from the great
mass of his poetic material in gravity of importance and in
breadth of treatment,         — " Ode to Duty," " Lines composed
above Tintern Abbey," and " Ode on Intimations of Immor-
tality."    They reach the highest pinnacle of his reflective
imagery.     In the      first   of this trio of poems, .the author

recognizes the supremacy of God, as a personal Deity.                 Man
is   allied with   Him by a love of truth and freedom.               Duty,
" Stern    Daughter of the Voice of God," summons man to
service for God, not for a pantheistic image of Divinity               :
                                                                           —
                   " Give unto me, made lowly wise.
                     The spirit of self-sacrifice."
     The second     of   these     poems, " Lines       composed above
Tintern Abbey," describes the fond delight of the heart
                                  INTRODUCTION.                                        25

returning to          its early joy.      What fascinating           allusions to
natural           scenery are found here!            How closely the poet
connects " the landscape with the quiet of the sky "                         !        He
follows " the lines of sportive                  mood run wild "      ;    he casts
himself into the lap of that dear region which he loved.
After giving the splendid picture                   its full   glory in words,
he passes on to consider the change wrought in him during
his    long absence.             "The   still,   sad music of humanity,"
with        its   "ample power to chasten and subdue," mingles
with the memories of the past.
     The last of the three poems, "Ode on Intimations of
Immortality,"          is    regarded by    many as the finest poem in
the English language.                Man    existed before he             was upon
the earth, therefore he will exist after he leaves                         it.        All
these       poems have many quotable               lines   that have passed
into our language, into the social                  and    ethical   philosophy
of our time.

     No other poet seemed to care so little for style. Matthew
Arnold claimed that he had none.                      The truth is, Words-
worth was so filled with the momentum of his thought as
to    make         the " music of mere meter "              secondary to the
deeper flow of ideas, the swaying governance of truth.
Our poet believed it was " the tendency of meter to divest
language, to a certain degree, of its reality."
     In order to read Wordsworth appreciatively we must
rise to a          high moral and spiritual vantage-ground.                           We
must come to know and feel that nature has a voice                               ;   that
man is not a machine, but a soul into whose innermost
being enter feelings that cannot be treated lightly.                                 Love
is    the    medium         of   insight into nature and man.               Words-

worth, from spiritual motives of the highest order, by
intuitions of beauty            and truth unsurpassed in the entire
range of modern poetry, has defined for us the world that
lies about us.

  His fame, built on a great purpose, — to open to us the
unseen and shape into form the vague and the intangible, —
is impregnably fixed.            Shining through all his poems, which
at times reach the sublimest heights of poetic vision,                    we
see the noble character of the                  man, of     whom Tennyson
declares that the laurel crown                  was greener because worn
by a poet of such moral elevation.



                                ESTIMATES.
     " I firmly believe that the poetical performance of Words-

worth is, after that of Shakespeare and Milton, of which
all    the world       now recognizes the worth, undoubtedly the
most considerable in our language from the Elizabethan age
to the present time.                  Chaucer   is   anterior,   and on other
grounds, too, he cannot well be brought into the compari-
son.     But taking the roll of our chief poetical names, beside
Shakespeare and Milton, from the age of Elizabeth down,
and going through               it,   — Spenser, Dry den, Pope, Gray,
Goldsmith,       Cowper,        Burns,     Coleridge,      Scott,   Campbell,
Moore, Byron, Shelley, Keats                (I   mention those only who
are dead),   —     I    think    it    certain that Wordsworth's        name
deserves to stand, and will finally stand, above them                     all.

Wordsworth seems to me to have left a body of poetical
work superior in power, in interest, in the qualities which
give enduring freshness, to that which any of the others

have    left.   No poet, perhaps, is so evidently filled with
a    new and sacred energy when            the           inspiration   is   upon
him.     He is one of the chief glories of English poetry,
and by nothing is England so glorious as by her poetry.

and will, in their degree, be           efficacious         in    making men
wiser, better,    and happier.'" — Selected.


     "Wordsworth's mission has been a lofty one and loftily
fulfilled,   — to raise the mean, to dignify the obscure, to
reveal that natural nobility which lurks under the russet
gown and the       clouted shoe;        to extract poetry              from the
cottage,     from the turf-fire upon       its       hearth, and from the
solitary shieling,    and from the mountain tarn, and from
the gray ancestral stone at the door of the mansion, and
from the lichens of the rock, and from the furze of the mel-
ancholy moor              It   was to interweave the deductions
of a subtle philosophy with         '

of the poor.'       And how to          the waste and meaningless
parts of creation has he, above           all    men, given a voice, an
intelligence, a beauty.        The sweet and solitary laugh of a
joyous female, echoing among the hills,                    is   to the ear more

delightful than the music of many forests.                      A wooden bowl

     " There are those who refuse to call Wordsworth a great

poet, for the reason that there are so                    many commonplace
and prosaic pages in his collected works.                       But there are
two reasons for calling him great which these critics over-
look.           First, the large       body of genuine poetry which these
works contain           ;   and, secondly, the rare bent and insight
which these works have communicated to literature.                          The
Sonnets of Wordsworth constitute of themselves our noblest
collection after those of Shakespeare and Milton, and there

is   a grave and serious beauty even in poems as long as
the     '
            Prelude' and the 'Excursion.'                His chief claim to
greatness, however,            is      this,    that he has not only appre-
hended and expressed the divinity of nature as                         it   had
never been apprehended and expressed before, but that
he has done this in such a way as to mold and change the
poetry of the country and of the world and to begin a new
epoch in the history of literature."                 — A. H. Strong.

                      THE EXCURSION.
  The "Excursion" is Wordsworth's longest poem.           It was

published in 1814, although large portions of it were writ-
30                            INTRODUCTION.

ten several years before.              Wordsworth intended to use it
as the second part of a still longer poem to be called " The

Recluse."         Of   this   larger    work we have, besides "The
Excursion," only the closing lines of the first part.               Words-
worth planned, but did not produce, the third part.                     His
conceptions of human life, intended for this portion, found
their way into some of his later poems.
     " The Excursion " is the record of           Wordsworth's purpose
to build       up something on which             his   fame might perma-
nently rest.       He believed that in order to do this he must
write on philosophical subjects, though he disclaimed all
" intention of formally announcing a system."                   If the poet

succeeds in stirring up in the mind " clear thought, lively
images, and strong feelings," the reader can frame his own
system.
     In the four books that comprise " The Excursion," sub'
jects   of     a somewhat recondite nature are treated under
the following divisions,          viz.,   Book I. "The Wanderer";
Book     II.    "The    Solitary";        Book    III.     "Despondency";
Book IV. "Despondency Corrected."                        Instead of calling
these    poems philosophy, we may better characterize them
as casuistry under a philosophic            mode of treatment, in un-
scholastic      and unpedantic language.
     Wordsworth discussed some of the deepest problems in
philosophy; but he never assumed to be profound.                       The
dedication of this poem to the Earl of Lonsdale                   is full   of

genuine respect, as this        quotation shows —      :




             " Oft through the fair domains, illustrous peer!
               In youth I roamed on youthful pleasures bent
               And mused in rocky cell or sylvan tent,
                               INTRODUCTION.                                    31

            Beside swift-flowing Lowther's current clear.
            — Now, by thy care befriended,             I appear

            Before thee, Lonsdale, and this work present
            A token (may       it    prove a monument !)
            Of high respect and gratitude sincere."


  This production of the man with the "wizard imagina-
tion" was pronounced "madness."                         It   was the madness
which Seneca regarded a proof of genius.                            Wordsworth
presents a fine example of judicious disregard of the carp-
ing criticisms of his day.                   He was actuated by a strict
literary conscientiousness                 which would not yield to the
floods of caustic criticism that surged about him.

  Jeffries said of " The Excursion," " This wT ill never do."

But it has done well, and holds its own against the echoes
of remonstrance that come                  down to us from the day it was
given to the world.           As a narrative poem, it lacks dramatic
action, which is so prominent a feature of Matthew Arnold's
" Sohrab     and Kustum," but as a work of broad ethical
thinking, chaste           spirit,       and refined    diction,   it   is   of the
choicest mold.             That a common peddler should converse
like a sage, treat the              most obscure themes as if he were
versed in philosophy,               is   an incongruity, but the trend of
the   poem is strong, healthful, wise.
  When one thinks of the varied charm of this poem, he
chooses it without hesitation as worthy the attention of the
student of English literature.                  How genuine its intimacy
with Nature     !       how graphic and at times uplifting its recital
of her graces       !
                         " what haunting memories hover around us,

deep and eternal, like the undying baritone of the sea "                         !




How   r

                        THE WANDERER.
                               ARGUMENT.

                         —
  A summer forenoon The author reaches a ruined cottage upon a
common, and there meets with a revered friend, the wanderer, of
whose education and course of life he gives an account     —
                                                       The wan-
derer, while resting   under the shade of the trees that surround the
cottage, relates the history of its last inhabitant.


     'Twas summer, and the sun had mounted high
     Southward the landscape indistinctly glared.
     Through a pale steam but all the northern downs,
                                 ;



     In clearest air ascending, showed far off
     A surface dappled o'er with shadows flung                      5
     From brooding clouds shadows that lay in spots
                                  ;



     Determined and unmoved, with steady beams
     Of bright and pleasant sunshine interposed
     To him most pleasant who on soft cool moss
     Extends his careless limbs along the front                    10

     Of some huge cave, whose rocky ceiling casts
     A twilight of its own, an ample shade,
     Where the wren warbles, while the dreaming man,
     Half conscious of the soothing melody,
     With side-long eye looks out upon the scene,                  15

     By power of that impending covert, thrown

     To finer distance. Mine was at that hour
     Far other lot, yet with good hope that soon
     Under a shade as grateful I should find
     Rest, and be welcomed there to livelier joy.           20

     Across a bare wide common I was toiling
     With languid steps that by the slippery turf
     Were baffled nor could my weak arm disperse
                  ;




     The host of insects gathering round my face,
     And ever with me as I paced along.                     25



       Upon that open moorland stood a grove,
     The wished-for port to which my course was bound.
     Thither I came, and there, amid the gloom
     Spread by a brotherhood of lofty elms,
     Appeared a roofless hut four naked walls
                                 ;                          30

     That stared upon each other         —
                                     I looked round,
                                     !




     And to my wish and to my hope espied
     The friend I sought   ;   a man of reverend age,
     But stout and hale, for travel nnimpaired.
     There was he seen upon the cottage-bench,              35

     Recumbent in the shade, as if asleep
     An iron-pointed staff lay at his side.

       Him had I marked the day before, — alone
     And stationed in the public way, with face
     Turned toward the sun then setting, while that staff   40

     Afforded, to the figure of the man
     Detained for contemplation or repose,
     Graceful support his countenance as he stood
                       ;




     Was hidden from my view, and he remained
     Unrecognized; but, stricken by the sight,              45

     With slackened footsteps I advanced, and soon
     A glad congratulation we exchanged
     At such unthought-of meeting.           —
                                     For the night
     We parted, nothing willingly and now;
                      THE WANDERER.                      35

He by appointment waited for me here,                    50

Under the covert of these clustering elms.

  "We were tried friends amid a pleasant vale,
                             :




In the antique market- village where was passed
My school-time, an apartment he had owned,
To which at intervals the wanderer drew,                 55

And found a kind of home or harbor there.
He loved me from a swarm of rosy boys
              ;



Singled out me, as he in sport would say,
For my grave looks, too thoughtful for my years.
As I grew up, it was my best delight                     60

To be his chosen comrade. Many a time,
On holidays, we rambled through the woods        :



         —
We sat, we walked he pleased me with report
                         ;



Of things which he had seen and often touched
                                 ;



Abstrusest matter, reasonings of the mind                65

Turned inward or at my request would sing
                  ;



Old songs, the product of his native hills
A skillful distribution of sweet sounds,
Feeding the soul, and eagerly imbibed
As cool refreshing water, by the care                    70
Of the industrious husbandman, diffused
Through a parched meadow-ground, in time of drought.
Still deeper welcome found his pure discourse        ;



How precious, when in riper days I learned
To weigh with care his words, and to rejoice             75

In the plain presence of his dignity   !




  Oh many are the poets that are sown
     !




By Nature; men endowed with highest gifts,
The vision and the faculty divine
Yet wanting the accomplishment of verse,                 80

     Or a nice backwardness afraid of shame)              85

     Nor having e'er, as life advanced, been led
     By circumstance to take unto the height
     The measure of themselves, these favored beings,
     All but a scattered few, live out their time,
     Husbanding that which they possess within,           90

     And go to the grave, unthought of. Strongest minds
     Are often those of whom the noisy world
     Hears least else surely this man had not left
                 ;



     His graces unrevealed and unproclaimed.
     But, as the mind was filled with inward light,       95

     So not without distinction had he lived,
     Beloved and honored,    —far as he was known.
     And some small portion of his eloquent speech,
     And something that may serve to set in vieAV
     The feeling pleasures of his loneliness,             100

     His observations, and the thoughts his mind
     Had dealt with, I will here record in verse
     Which, if with truth it correspond, and sink
     Or rise as venerable nature leads,
     The high and tender muses shall accept               105

     With gracious smile, deliberately pleased,
     And listening time reward with sacred praise.

       Among the hills of Athol he was born
     Where, on a small hereditary farm,
     An unproductive slip of rugged ground,               HO
     His parents, with their numerous offspring, dwelt
     A virtuous household, though exceeding poor
     Pure livers were they all, austere and grave,
     And fearing God   ;   the very children taught
     Stern self-respect, a reverence for God's word,      115

     And an habitual piety, maintained
     With strictness scarcely known on English ground.
                      THE WANDERER.                 37

  From his sixth year, the boy of whom I speak,
In summer, tended cattle on the hills
But through the inclement and the perilous days     120

Of long-continuing winter, he repaired,
Equipped with satchel, to a school that stood
Sole building on a mountain's dreary edge,
Kemote from view of city spire, or sound
Of minster clock     From that bleak tenement
                      !                             125

He, many an evening, to his distant home
In solitude returning, saw the hills
Grow larger in the darkness all alone
                                   ;



Beheld the stars come out above his head,
And traveled through the wood, with no one near     130

To whom he might confess the things he saw.

  So the foundations of his mind were laid.
In such communion, not from terror free,
While yet a child, and long before his time,
Had he perceived the presence and the power         135

Of greatness and deep feelings had impressed
             ;




So vividly great objects, that they lay
Upon his mind like substances, whose presence
Perplexed the bodily sense.    He had received
A precious gift   ;         grew in years,
                      for, as he                    140
With these impressions would he still compare
All his remembrances, thoughts, shapes, and forms
And, being still unsatisfied with aught
Of dimmer character, he thence attained
An active power to fasten images                    145

Upon his brain and on their pictured lines
                  ;



Intensely brooded, even till they acquired
The liveliness of dreams. Nor did he fail,
While yet a child, with a child's eagerness
Incessantly to turn his ear and eye                 150
On all things which the moving seasons brought

     To feed such appetite,   — nor this alone
     Appeased his yearning    :
                               —in the after-day
     Of boyhood, many an hour in caves forlorn,
     And 'mid the hollow depths of naked crags                 155

     He sat, and even in their fixed lineaments,
     Or from the power of a peculiar eye,
     Or by creative feeling overborne,
     Or by predominance of thought oppressed,
     Even in their fixed and steady lineaments                 160

     He traced an ebbing and a flowing mind,
     Expression ever varying
                                      Thus informed,
     He had small need of books        ;   for many a tale
     Traditionary round the mountains hung,
     And many a legend, peopling the dark woods,               165

     Nourished imagination in her growth,
     And gave the mind that apprehensive power
     By which she is made quick to recognize
     The moral properties and scope of things.

     Whate'er the minister's old shelf supplied

     Of persecution, and the covenant         —
                                          times                175

     Whose echo rings through Scotland to this hour
     And there, by lucky hap, had been preserved
     A straggling volume, torn and incomplete,
     That left half-told the preternatural tale,

     Profuse in garniture of wooden cuts
     Strange and uncouth; dire faces, figures dire,

     Could never be forgotten     !

Where fear sat thus, a cherished visitant,
Was wanting yet the pure delight of love
By sound diffused, or by the breathing air,
Or by the silent looks of happy things,
Or flowing from the universal face                                   190

Of earth and sky. Bnt he had felt the power
Of Nature and already was prepared,
By his intense conceptions, to receive
Deeply the lesson deep of love which he,
Whom Nature, by whatever means, has taught                           195

To feel but intensely, cannot but receive.

  Such was the boy,                 —
                       but for the growing youth
What  soul was his, when, from the naked top
Of some bold headland, he beheld the sun
Rise up, and bathe the world in light
                                                     He looked   :   200

Ocean and earth, the solid frame of earth
And ocean's liquid mass, in gladness lay
Beneath him   :       —Far and wide the clouds were touched,
And in their silent faces conld he read
Unutterable love.               Sound needed none,                   205

Nor any voice of joy his spirit drank
                                    ;




The spectacle sensation, soul, and form,
                  :




All melted into him they swallowed up
                                ;




His animal being in them did he live,
                            ;




And by them did he live they were his life.

In such access of mind, in such high hour
Of visitation from the living God,
Thought was not in enjoyment it expired.
                        ;




No thanks he breathed, he proffered no request
Rapt into still communion that transcends                            215

The imperfect offices of prayer and praise,
His mind was a thanksgiving to the power
That made him: it was blessedness and love!

     A herdsman on the lonely mountain tops,
     Such intercourse was his, and in this sort                   220

     Was his existence oftentimes possessed.
       then how beautiful, how bright, appeared
     The written promise  ! Early had he learned
     To reverence the volume that displays
     The mystery, the life which cannot die                   ;
                                                                  225

     But in the mountains did he feel his faith.
     All things, responsive to the writing, there
     Breathed immortality, revolving life,
     And greatness still revolving         ;   infinite   :




     There littleness was not; the least of things     230

     Seemed infinite and there his spirit shaped
                     ;



     Her prospects, nor did he believe, he saw.      —
     What wonder if his being thus became

                                                 ;



     Lowly for he was meek in gratitude,
            ;




     Oft as he called those ecstasies to mind,
     And whence they flowed and from them he acquired
                                   ;




     Wisdom, which works through patience; thence he
         learned
     In oft-recurring hours of sober thought                      240

     To look on Nature with a humble heart,
     Self-questioned where it did not understand,
     And with a superstitious eye of love.

       So passed the time     ;
                                  yet to the nearest town
     He duly went with what small overplus                        245
     His earnings might supply, and brought away
     The book that most had tempted his desires
     While at the stall he read. Among the hills
     He gazed upon that mighty orb of song,

The purer elements of truth involved
In lines and numbers, and, by charm severe,

Busy in solitude and poverty.
These occupations oftentimes deceived
The listless hours, while in the hollow vale,
Hollow and green, he lay on the green turf       260

In pensive idleness. What could he do,
Thus daily thirsting, in that lonesome life,
With blind endeavors ? Yet, still uppermost,
Nature was at his heart as if he felt,
Though yet he knew not how, a wasting power      265

In all things that from her sweet influence
Might tend to wean him. Therefore with her hues,
Her forms, and with the spirit of her forms,
He clothed the nakedness of austere truth.
While yet he lingered in the rudiments           270

Of science, and among her simplest laws,
His triangles they were the stars of heaven,
The silent stars!   Oft did he take delight
To measure the altitude of some tall crag
That is the eagle's birthplace, or some peak     275

Familiar with forgotten years, that shows,
Inscribed upon its visionary sides,
The history of many a winter storm,
Or obscure records of the path of fire.

With still increasing weight he was o'erpowered

           ;

     Full often wished he that the winds might rage
     When they were silent              :   far more fondly now
     Than in his earlier season did he love
     Tempestuous nights,            —

     And from the stillness of abstracted thought
     He asked repose and, failing oft to win

     Amid the roar of torrents, where they send                   295

     A cloud of mist, that, smitten by the sun,

     Of humble industry that promised best                        310

     To yield him no unworthy maintenance.
     Urged by his mother, he essayed to teach
     A village-school, — but wandering thoughts were then
     A misery to him and the youth resigned

Yet do such travelers find their own delight
And their hard service, deemed debasing now,
Gained merited respect in simpler times

In rustic sequestration        —

     Serene it was, unclouded by the cares
     Of ordinary life unvexed, unwarped
                     ;



     By partial bondage. In his steady course,
     No piteous revolutions had he felt,
     No wild varieties of joy and grief.                         360
     Unoccupied by sorrow of its own,
     His heart lay open and, by nature tuned

     To sympathy with man, he was alive
     To all that was enjoyed where'er he went,                   365

     Happy, and quiet in his cheerfulness,
     He had no painful pressure from without
     That made him turn aside from wretchedness
     With coward fears. He could afford to surfer                370
     With those whom he saw suffer. Hence it came
     That in our best experience he was rich,
     And in the wisdom of our daily life.
     For hence, minutely, in his various rounds,
     He had observed the progress and decay                      375

     To pass the remnant of his days, untasked
     With needless services, from hardship free.                 385

     His calling laid aside, he lived at ease:
     But still he loved to pace the public roads

And the wild paths   ;   and, by the summer's warmth
Invited, often would he leave his home
And journey far, revisiting the scenes                   390

That to his memory were most endeared.
— Vigorous in health, of hopeful     spirits, undamped

By worldly-mindedness or anxious care
Observant, studious, thoughtful, and refreshed
By knowledge gathered up from day to day                 395

Thus had he lived a long and innocent life.

  The Scottish church, both on himself and those
With whom from childhood he grew up, had held
The strong hand of her purity and still
                                 ;



Had watched him with an unrelenting eye.                 400
This he remembered in his riper age
With gratitude, and reverential thoughts.
But by the native vigor of his mind,
By his habitual wanderings out of doors,
By loneliness, and goodness, and kind works,             405
Whate'er, in docile childhood or in youth,
He had imbibed of fear or darker thought
Was melted all away so true was this,
                         ;



That sometimes his religion seemed to me
Self-taught, as of a dreamer in the woods                410
Who to the model of his own pure heart
Shaped his belief, as grace divine inspired,
And human reason dictated with awe.
— And surely never did there live on earth
A man of kindlier nature. The rough sports               415

And teasing ways of children vexed not him
Indulgent listener was he to the tongue
Of garrulous age nor did the sick man's tale,

     Such as might suit a rustic sire, prepared
     For Sabbath duties yet he was a man

     Whom no one could have passed without remark.
     Active and nervous was his gait his limbs;



     And his whole figure breathed intelligence.                     425
     Time had compressed the freshness of his cheek
     Into a narrower circle of deep red,
     But had not tamed his eye that, under brows
                                        ;



     Shaggy and gray, had meanings which it brought
     From years of youth which, like a being made

     Of my approaching steps, and in the shade
     Unnoticed did I stand some minutes' space.
     At length I hailed him, seeing that his hat
     Was moist with water-drops, as if the brim                      445

Of garden ground run wild, its matted weeds
Marked with the steps of those, whom, as they passed, 455
The gooseberry trees that shot in long, lank slips,
Or currants, hanging from their leafless stems,
In scanty strings, had tempted to o'erleap
The broken wall. I looked around, and there,
Where two tall hedge-rows of thick alder boughs         460

Joined in a cold damp nook, espied a well
Shrouded with willow-flowers and plumy fern.
My thirst I slaked, and, from the cheerless spot
Withdrawing, straightway to the shade returned
Where sat the old man on the cottage-bench              4G5

And, while, beside him, with uncovered head,
I yet was standing, freely to respire,
And cool my temples in the fanning air,
Thus did he speak " I see around me here

Nor we alone, but that which each man loved
And prized in his peculiar nook of earth
Dies with him, or is changed    ;       and very soon
Even of the good is no memorial left.

More tranquil, yet perhaps of kindred birth,
That steal upon the meditative mind,

                            At this the wanderer paused
And, looking up to those enormous elms,
He said, " 'T is now the hour of deepest noon.
At this still season of repose and peace,
This hour when all things which are not at rest       595

Are cheerful while this multitude of flies
               ;



With tuneful hum is filling all the air
Why should a tear be on an old man's cheek ?
Why should we thus, with an untoward mind,
And in the weakness of humanity,                      600

From natural wisdom turn our hearts away
To natural comfort shut our eyes and ears
And, feeding on disquiet, thus disturb
The calm of nature with our restless thoughts ? "


He spake with somewhat of a solemn tone               605
But, when he ended, there was in his face
Such easy cheerfulness, a look so mild,
That for a little time it stole away
All recollection and that simple tale
                   ;



Passed from my mind like a forgotten sound.           610
A while on trivial things Ave held discourse,
To me soon tasteless.       In my own despite,
I thought of that poor woman as of one
Whom I had known and loved. He had rehearsed
Her homely tale with such familiar power,             615

W ith such an active countenance, an eye
    T


So busy, that the things of which he spake
Seemed present     ;   and, attention now relaxed,
A heartfelt chillness crept along my veins.
I rose and, having left the breezy shade,
         ;                                            620

That had not cheered me long, ere, looking round

     Upon that tranquil ruin, I returned,
     And begged of the old man that, for my sake,
     He would resume his story.
                                  He replied                     :             625
     " It were a wantonness, and would demand

     Severe reproof, if we were men whose hearts
     Could hold vain dalliance with the misery
     Even of the dead contented thence to draw
                               ;



     A momentary pleasure, never marked                                        630

     By reason, barren of all future good.
     But we have known that there is often found
     In mournful thoughts, and always might be found,
     A power to virtue friendly              ;   were 't not so,
     I am a dreamer among men, indeed                                          635

                           !




     An ordinary sorrow of man's life,
     A tale of silent suffering, hardly clothed
     In bodily form.      — But without further bidding

     To whom this cottage, till those hapless years,
     Had been a blessed home, it was my chance
     To travel in a country far remote
     And when these lofty elms once more appeared,
     What pleasant expectations lured me on                                    645

     O'er the flat common                —

     The threshold, lifted with light hand the latch
     But, when I entered, Margaret looked at me
     A little while   ;   then turned her head away
     Speechless,   — and,          sitting down upon a chair,                  650

     Wept bitterly. I wist not what to do,                   '




     Nor how to speak to her. Poor wretch                    !       at last
     She rose from off her seat, and then,     Sir       —
     I cannot tell how she pronounced my name                         :

Unutterably helpless, and a look
That seemed to cling upon me, she inquired
If I had seen her husband.    As she spake
A strange surprise and fear came to my heart,
Nor had I power to answer ere she told                        660
That he had disappeared,                  —
                             not two months gone.
He left his house two wretched days had past,
                        :




And on the third, as wistfully she raised
Her head from off her pillow, to look forth,
Like one in trouble, for returning light,                     665
Within her chamber-casement she espied
A folded paper, lying as if placed
To meet her waking eyes.                   This tremblingly
She opened,    — found no writing, but beheld
Pieces of money carefully enclosed,                           670
Silver and gold.            '   I shuddered at the sight,'
Said Margaret, for I knew it was his hand
                   '



That must have placed it there and ere that day
                                              ;



Was ended, that long anxious day, I learned,
From one who by my husband had been sent                      675
With the sad news, that he had joined a troop
Of soldiers, going to a distant land.
— He   left   me thus,          — he could not gather heart
To take a farewell of me              ;   for he feared
That I should follow with my babes, and sink                  680

Beneath the misery of that wandering life/

  "This tale did Margaret tell with many tears
And, when she ended, I had little power
To give her comfort, and was glad to take
Such words of hope from her own mouth as served               685

To cheer us both. But long we had not talked
Ere we built up a pile of better thoughts,
And with a brighter eye she looked around,
As if she had been shedding tears of joy.

     We parted. — T was the time of early spring             690
     I left her busy with her garden tools
     And well remember, o'er that fence she looked,
     And, while I paced along the foot-way path,
     Called out, and sent a blessing after me,
     With tender cheerfulness, and with a voice              695
     That seemed the very sound of happy thoughts.

       " I roved o'er many a hill and many a dale,
     With my accustomed load in heat and cold,
                                   ;




     Through many a wood and many an open ground,
     In sunshine and in shade, in wet and fair,           700
     Drooping or blithe of heart, as might befall
     My best companions now the driving winds,
     And now the trotting brooks and whispering trees,
                       *

     And now the music of my own sad steps,
     With many a short-lived thought that passed between, 705
     And disappeared.
                           " I journeyed back this way,
     When, in the warmth of midsummer, the wheat
     Was yellow and the soft and bladed grass,
                   ;




     Springing afresh, had o'er the hay-field spread
     Its tender verdure.      At the door arrived,           710
     I   found that she was absent. In the shade,
     Where now we sit, I waited her return.
     Her cottage, then a cheerful object, wore
     Its customary look,   —
                           only, it seemed,
     The honeysuckle, crowding round the porch,       715
     Hung down in heavier tufts and that bright weed,
                                       ;



     The yellow stone-crop, suffered to take root
     Along the window's edge, profusely grew,
     Blinding the lower panes.         I turned aside,
     And strolled into her garden.             It appeared   720
     To lag behind the season, and had lost
     Its pride of neatness.     Daisy-flowers and thrift

Had broken their trim border-lines, and straggled
O'er paths they used to deck     :   carnations, once
Prized for surpassing beauty, and no less                             725

For the peculiar pains they had required,
Declined their languid heads, wanting support.
The cumbrous bind-weed, with its wreaths and bells,
Had twined about her two small rows of peas,
And dragged them to the earth.
                                             " Ere this an hour       730

Was wasted. — Back I turned my restless steps
A stranger passed and, guessing whom I sought,
                  ;



He said that she was used to ramble far. —
The sun was sinking in the west      and now
                                         ;




I sat with sad impatience.      From within                           735

Her solitary infant cried aloud
Then, like a blast that dies away self-stilled,
The voice was silent. From the bench I rose
But neither could divert nor soothe my thoughts.
The spot, though fair, was very desolate,           —                 740

The longer I remained, more desolate            :




And, looking round me, now I first observed
The corner stones, on either side the porch,
With dull red stains discolored, and stuck o'er
With tufts and hairs of wool, as if the sheep,                        745

That fed upon the common, thither came
Familiarly, and found a couching-place
Even at her threshold. Deeper shadows fell
From these tall elms   ;   the cottage-clock struck eight         :
                                                                      —
I turned, and saw her distant a few steps.                            750

Her face was pale and thin,     —
                               her figure, too,
Was changed. As she unlocked the door, she said,
*
 It grieves me you have waited here so long,
But, in good truth, I 've wandered much of late           ;



And sometimes   — to my shame speak — have need

     While on the board she spread our evening meal,
     She told me   —
                   interrupting not the work
     Which gave employment to her listless hands             —
     That she had parted with her elder child                        760
     To a kind master on a distant farm
     Now happily apprenticed. — I perceive  '

  Your very soul to see her         :    evermore
 Her eyelids drooped, her eyes downward were cast
 And, when she at her table gave me food,
 She did not look at me.            Her voice was low,
 Her body was subdued.              In every act                      795
 Pertaining to her house-affairs, appeared
 The careless stillness of a thinking mind
 Self-occupied to which all outward things

 Are like an idle matter. Still she sighed,
 But yet no motion of the breast was seen,

   " Ere my departure, to her care

And took my rounds along this road again
When on its sunny bank the primrose flower                          8i5

I found her sad and drooping:

Bespake a sleepy hand of negligence

     Which, in the cottage-window, heretofore                     825
     Had been piled up against the corner panes
     In seemly order, now, with straggling leaves
     Lay scattered here and there, open or shut,
     As they had chanced to fall. Her infant babe
     Had from his mother caught the trick of grief,               830
     And sighed among its playthings. I withdrew,
     And, once again, entering the garden saw,
     More plainly still, that poverty and grief
     Were now come nearer to her weeds defaced:




     The hardened soil, and knots of withered grass          :    835

     No ridges there appeared of clear black mold,
     No winter greenness of her herbs and flowers,

     It seemed the better part was gnawed away
     Or trampled into earth      ;       a chain of straw,
     Which had been twined about the slender stem                 840

     Of a young apple tree, lay at its root
     The bark was nibbled round by truant sheep.
     — Margaret stood near, her infant in her arms,
     And, noting that my eye was on the tree,
     She said, I fear it will be dead and gone

     We had returned together, she inquired
     If I had any hope   :   —
                            but for her babe
     And for her little orphan boy, she said,
     She had no wish to live, that she must die                   850

     Of sorrow. Yet I saw the idle loom
     Still in its place
                     ;  his Sunday garments hung
     Upon the self-same nail         ;   his very staff
     Stood undisturbed behind the door.

     In bleak December, I retraced this way,                      855

From her maternal cares, had taken up
The employment common through these wilds, and
    gained,
By spinning hemp, a pittance for herself                   860

And for this end had hired a neighbor's boy
To give her needful help. That very time
Most willingly she put her work aside,
And walked with me along the miry road,
Heedless how far       ;   and, in such piteous sort       865

That any heart had ached to hear her, begged
That, whereso'er I went, I still would ask
For him whom she had lost. We parted then              —

From their first separation, nine long years,
She lingered in unquiet widowhood
A wife and widow. Needs must it have been

That in yon arbor oftentimes she sat
Alone, through half the vacant Sabbath day
And, if a dog passed by, she still would quit
The shade, and look abroad. On this old bench
For hours she sat and evermore her eye
                       ;                          880

Was busy in the distance, shaping things
That made her heart beat quick. You see that path,
Now faint, — the grass has crept o'er its gray line
There, to and fro, she paced through many a day
Of the warm summer, from a belt of hemp             885
That girt her waist, spinning the long-drawn thread
With backward steps. Yet ever as there passed
A man whose garments showed the soldier's red,
Or crippled mendicant in sailor's garb,

     Ceased from his task         ;       and she with faltering voice
     Made many a fond inquiry and when they,       ;




     Whose presence gave no comfort, Avere gone by,
     Her heart was still more sad. And by yon gate,
     That bars the traveler's road, she often stood,                           895

     And when a stranger horseman came, the latch
     Would lift, and in his face look wistfully                        ;


     Most happy, if, from aught discovered there
     Of tender feeling, she might dare repeat
     The same sad question. Meanwhile her poor hut                             900

     Sank to decay for he was gone, whose hand,
                      ;



     At the first nipping of October frost,
     Closed up each chink, and with fresh bands of straw
     Checkered the green-grown thatch.                         And so she lived
     Through the long winter, reckless and alone        905

     Until her house by frost, and thaw, and rain,
     Was sapped and while she slept, the nightly damps
                  ;



     Did chill her breast and in the stormy day
                              ;



     Her tattered clothes were ruffled by the wind,
     Even at the side of her own fire. Yet still        910

     She loved this wretched spot, nor would for worlds
     Have parted hence and still that length of road,
                          ;




     And this rude bench, one torturing hope endeared,
     Fast rooted at her heart              :       and here, my friend,
     In sickness she remained and here she died;                               915

       The old man ceased he saw that I was moved
                                      :




     From that low bench rising instinctively,
     I turned aside in weakness, nor had power
     To thank him for the tale which he had told.                              920

     I stood, and leaning, o'er the garden wall,
     Eeviewed that woman's sufferings                      ;   and it seemed
     To comfort me while with a brother's love
     I blessed her in the impotence of grief.

Then towards the cottage I returned   ;       and traced   925

Fondly, though with an interest more mild,
That secret spirit of humanity
Which, 'mid the calm, oblivious tendencies
Of nature, 'mid her plants, and weeds, and flowers,
And silent overgrowings, still survived.                   930
The old man, noting this, resumed, and said
" My friend enough to sorrow you have given,
            !




The purposes of wisdom ask no more        :




Nor more would she have craved as due to one
Who, in her worst distress, had ofttimes felt    935

The unbounded might of prayer and learned, with soul
                                 ;




Fixed on the cross, that consolation springs,
From sources deeper far than deepest pain,
For the meek sufferer. Why then should we read
The forms of things with an unworthy eye ?                 940
She sleeps in the calm earth, and peace is here.
I well remember that those very plumes,
Those weeds, and the high spear-grass on that wall,
By mist and silent rain-drops silvered o'er,
As once I passed, into my heart conveyed                   945
So still an image of tranquillity,
So calm and still, and looked so beautiful
Amid the uneasy thoughts which filled my mind,
That what we feel of sorrow and despair
From ruin and from change, and all the grief               950
That passing shows of being leave behind,
Appeared an idle dream, that could maintain,
Nowhere, dominion o'er the enlightened spirit
Whose meditative sympathies repose
Upon the breast of faith. I turned away,                   955
And walked along my road in happiness."

  He ceased.    Ere long the sun declining shot
A slant and mellow radiance, which began

          To fall upon us, while, beneath the trees,
          We sat on that low bench    and now we felt,
                                        :                             960

          Admonished thus, the sweet hour coming on.
          A linnet warbled from those lofty elms,
          A thrush sang loud, and other melodies,
          At distance heard, peopled the milder air.
          The old man rose, and, with a sprightly mien                 965

          Of hopeful preparation, grasped his staff
          Together casting then a farewell look

                             ALICE FELL;
                               OR, POVERTY.

     Written to gratify Mr. Grahame, of Glasgow, brother of the author
of   The Sabbath. He was a zealous coadjutor of Mr. Clarkson, and a
man of ardent humanity. The incident had happened to himself, and
he urged me to put it into verse for humanity's sake. The humble-
ness, meanness, if you like, of the subject, together with the homely
mode of treating it, brought upon me a world of ridicule by the small
critics, so that in policy I excluded it from many editions of my poems,

till it   was restored at the request of some of my friends, in particular
my son-in-law, Edward Quillinan.

            The post-boy drove with fierce career,
            For threatening clouds the moon had drowned,
            When, as we hurried on, my ear
            Was smitten with a startling sound.

            As if the wind blew many ways,
            I heard the sound,    — and more and more
            It seemed to follow with the chaise,
            And still I heard it as before.
                    ALICE FELL                               63

At length I to the boy called out.
He stopped his horses at the word,
But neither cry, nor voice, nor shout,
Nor aught else like it, could be heard.

The boy then smacked his whip, and fast
The horses scampered through the rain
But, hearing soon upon the blast
The cry, I bade him halt again.

Forthwith alighting on the ground,
" Whence comes," said I, " this piteous moan ? "

And there a little girl I found,
Sitting behind the chaise, alone.

" My cloak " no other word she spake,
            !




But loud and bitterly she wept,
As if her innocent heart would break
And down from off her seat she leapt.

" What ails you, child ? "     She sobbed, " Look here   !




I saw it in the wheel entangled,
A weather-beaten rag as e'er
From any garden scarecrow dangled.

There, twisted between nave and spoke,
It hung, nor could at once be freed
But our joint pains unloosed the cloak,
A miserable rag indeed     !




" And whither are you going, child,
To-night, along these lonesome ways ? "
" To Durham, " answered she, half wild.
" Then come with me into the chaise."

Insensible to all relief
Sat the poor girl, and forth did send

     Sob after sob, as if her grief
     Could never, never have an end.

     "My child, in Durham do you dwell ? "
     She checked herself in her distress,
     And said, " My name is Alice Fell
     I'm fatherless and motherless.

     " And I to Durham, Sir, belong."

     Again, as if the thought would choke
     Her very heart, her grief grew strong
     And all was for her tattered cloak        !




     The chaise drove on    ;
                                our journey's end
     Was nigh   ;   and, sitting by my side,
     As if she had lost her only friend
     She wept, nor would be pacified.

     Up to the tavern door we post
     Of Alice and her grief I told     ;


     And I gave money to the host,
     To buy a new cloak for the old.

     " And let it be of duffel gray,
                                               "
     As warm a cloak as man can sell       !




     Proud creature was she the next day,

                     LUCY GEAY;
                      OR, SOLITUDE.

     Oft I had heard of Lucy Gray
     And, when I crossed the wild,
     I chanced to see, at break of day,
     The solitary child.
            LUCY GRAY.                          65

No mate, no comrade Lucy knew
She dwelt on a wide moor,          —
The sweetest thing that ever grew
Beside a human door

You yet may spy the fawn at play,
The hare upon the green        ;



But the sweet face of Lucy Gray
Will never more be seen.

" To-night will be a stormy night,          —
You to the town must go
And take a lantern, child, to light
Your mother through the snow."

" That, Father   !   will I gladly do
'Tis scarcely afternoon,
The minster-clock has just struck two,
                                   "
And yonder is the moon         !




At this the father raised his hook,
And snapped a fagot-band
He plied his work          —
                    and Lucy took
                       ;



The lantern in her hand.

Not blither is the mountain roe         :




With many a wanton stroke
Her feet disperse the powdery snow,
That rises up like smoke.

The storm came on before its time
She wandered up and down
And many a hill did Lucy climb
But never reached the town.

The wretched parents all that night
Went shouting far and wide

     But there was neither sound nor sight
     To serve them for a guide.

     At daybreak on the hill they stood
     That overlooked the moor
     And thence they saw the bridge of wood,
     A furlong from their door.
     They wept,   — and, turning homeward,    cried,
                                     —
     " In heaven we all shall meet ; "

     When in the snow the mother spied
     The print of Lucy's feet.

     Then downwards from the steep hill's edge
     They tracked the footmarks small
     And through the broken hawthorn-hedge,
     And by the long stone wall

     And then an open field they crossed
     The marks were still the same;
     They tracked them on, nor ever lost
     And to the bridge they came.

     They followed from the snowy bank
     Those footmarks, one by one,
     Into the middle of the plank
     And further there were none    !




     — Yet some maintain that to this day
     She is a living child
     That you may see sweet Lucy Gray
     Upon the lonesome wild.

     O'er rough and smooth she trips along,
     And never looks behind
     And sings a solitary song
     That whistles in the wind.

                           WE ARE SEVEN.
   The little girl who is the heroine I met within the area of Goderich
Castle, in the year 1793.       I composed it while walking in the grove at

Alfoxden.        My friends will not deem it too trifling to relate, and while
walking to and fro I composed the last stanza first, having begun with
the last line.When it was all but finished, I came in and recited it to
Mr. Coleridge and my sister, and said, "A prefatory stanza must be
added, and I should sit down to our little tea-meal with greater pleas-
ure if my task was finished."       I mentioned in substance what I wished

to be      expressed, and    Coleridge immediately threw off the stanza
thus   :
           —          " A little child, dear brother Jem."

I objected to the rhyme,      "dear brother Jem," as being ludicrous; but
we all enjoyed the joke of hitching in our friend James Tobin's name.

                      A simple child,
               That lightly draws its breath,
               And feels its life in every limb,
               What should it know of death ?
               I met a little cottage girl
               She was eight years old, she said
               Her hair was thick with many a curl
               That clustered round her head.

               She had a rustic, w oodland air,
                                      r



               And she was wildly clad        :




               Her eyes were fair, and very fair;        —
               Her beauty made me glad.

               " Sisters and brothers, little maid,
               How many may you be ? "
               " How many ? Seven in all," she said,
               And wondering looked at me.
               " And where are they ?  I pray you tell."
               She answered, " Seven are we

     And, in the churchyard cottage, I
     Dwell near them with my mother."

     " You say that two at Conway dwell,
     And two are gone to sea,
     Yet ye are seven ! I pray you tell,
     Sweet maid, how this may be."

     Then did the little maid reply,
     " Seven boys and girls are we
     Two of us in the churchyard lie,
     Beneath the churchyard tree."

     " You run about, my little maid,
     Your limbs they are alive
     If two are in the churchyard laid
     Then ye are only five."

     " Their graves are green, they may be seen,' 7

     The little maid replied,
     " Twelve steps or more from my mother's door,
     And they are side by side.
     " My stockings there I often knit,

     My kerchief there I hem    ;


     And there upon the ground I sit
     And sing a song to them.
     "And often after sunset, sir,
     When it is light and fair,
     I take my little porringer,
     And eat my supper there.

" The first that died was sister Jane
In bed she moaning lay,
Till God released her of her pain
And then she went away.

" So in the churchyard she was laid
And, when the grass was dry,
Together round her grave we played,
My brother John and I.
" And when the ground was white with snow
And I could run and slide,
My brother John was forced to go,
And he lies by her side."

" How many are you, then," said I,
" If they two are in heaven ? "
Quick was the little maid's reply,
"0 Master! we are seven."

" But they are dead   ;   those two are dead       !



Their spirits are in heaven "  !




'T was throwing words away         ;   for still
The little maid would have her will,
And said, " Nay, we are seven          !

I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils,
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering: and dancing in the breeze.

     Continuous as the stars that shine
     And twinkle on the milky way,
     They stretched in never-ending line
     Along the margin of a bay        :




     Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
     Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

     The waves beside them danced      but they
                                              ;



     Outdid the sparkling waves in glee
     A poet could not but be gay,
     In such a jocund company
     I gazed, and gazed, but little thought
     What wealth the show to me had brought
     For oft, when on my couch I lie,
     In vacant or in pensive mood,
     They flash upon that inward eye
     Which is the bliss of solitude
     And then my heart with pleasure fills,
     And dances with the daffodils.

In youth from rock to rock I went,
From hill to hill, in discontent
Of pleasure high and turbulent,
  Most pleased when most uneasy
But now my own delights I make,      —
My thirst at every rill can slake,
And gladly nature's love partake,
    Of thee, sweet Daisy    !




Thee winter in the garland wears
That thinly decks his few gray hairs
Spring parts the clouds with softest airs,
  That she may sun thee
Whole summer-fields are thine by right;
And autumn, melancholy wight
Doth in thy crimson head delight
  When rains are on thee.

In shoals and bands, a morrice train,
Thou greet' st the traveler in the lane
Pleased at his greeting thee again   ;



  Yet nothing daunted,
Nor grieved, if thou be set at naught
And oft alone in nooks remote
We meet thee, like a pleasant thought,
  When such are wanted.

Be violets in their sacred mews
The flowers the wanton zephyrs choose
Proud be the rose, with rains and dews
  Her head impearling
Thou liv'st with less ambitious aim,
Yet hast not gone without thy fame       ;



Thou art indeed by many a claim
  The poet's darling.

               Which I, wherever thou art met,
                 To thee am owing
               An instinct call it, a blind sense
               A happy, genial influence,
               Coming one knows not how, nor whence,
                 Nor whither going.

               Child of the year    !   that round dost run
               Thy pleasant course,         —
                                        when day's begun
               As ready to salute the sun
                 As lark or leveret,
               Thy long-lost praise thou shalt regain
               Nor be less dear to future men
               Than in old time     ;   —
                                     thou not in vain
                    Art nature's favorite. 1

               With little here to do or see
               Of things that in the great world be,
               Daisy again I talk to thee,

                 For thou art worthy,
               Thou unassuming commonplace
               Of nature, with that homely face,
               And yet with something of a grace,
                    Which love makes for thee       !




               Oft on the dappled turf at ease
               I sit and play with similes,

     And many a fond and idle name
     I give to thee, for praise or blame,
     As is the humor of the game,
       While I am gazing.

     A nun demure, of lowly port
     Or sprightly maiden, of love's court,
     In thy simplicity the sport
       Of all temptations
     A queen in crown of rubies drest
     A starveling in a scanty vest
     Are all, as seems to suit thee best,
       Thy appellations.

     A little cyclops, with one eye
     Staring to threaten and defy,
     That thought comes next,       —
                                  and instantly
       The freak is over,
     The shape will vanish,   — and behold
     A silver shield with boss of gold,
     That spreads itself, some faery bold
       In fight to cover

     I see thee glittering from afar,   —
     And then thou art a pretty star
     Not quite so fair as many are
       In heaven above thee     !




     Yet like a star, with glittering crest,
     Self-poised in air thou seem'st to rest   ;   —
     May peace come never to his nest,
       Who shall reprove thee
     Bright Flower ! for by that name at last,
     When all my reveries are past,
     I call thee, and to that cleave fast,
       Sweet, silent creature

               That breath'st with me in sun and air,
               Do thou, as thou art wont, repair
               My heart with gladness, and a share
                  Of thy meek nature             !




                   TO THE SMALL CELANDINE.
                   WRITTEN AT TOWN-END, GRASMERE.

     It is   remarkable that this flower, coming out so early in the spring
as    it   does, and so bright and beautiful, and in such profusion, should
not have been noticed earlier in English verse.             What adds much to
the interest that attends it is its habit of shutting itself up and opening
out according to the degree of light and temperature of the air.


                  Pansies, lilies, kingcups, daisies,
                  Let them live upon their praises
                  Long as there \s a sun that sets,
                  Primroses will have their glory
                  Long as there are violets,
                  They will have a place in story
                  There 's a flower that shall be mine.
                  'T is the little Celandine.

                  Eyes of some men travel far
                  For the finding of a star
                  Up and down the heavens they go,
                  Men that keep a mighty rout
                  I 'm as great as they, I trow,
                  Since the day I found thee out,
                  Little flower   !   —   I'll   make a stir,
                  Like a sage astronomer.

                  Modest, yet withal an elf
                  Bold, and lavish of thyself
                  Since we needs must first have met,
                  I have seen thee, high and low.

      Thirty years or more, and yet
     'T was a face I did not know            :




     Thou hast now, go where I may,
     Fifty greetings in a day.

     Ere a leaf is on a bush,
     In the time before the thrush
     Has a thought about her nest,
     Thou wilt come with half a call,
     Spreading out thy glossy breast
     Like a careless prodigal
     Telling tales about the sun,
     When we've little warmth, or none.
     Poets, vain men in their mood
     Travel with the multitude           :




     Never heed them I aver;



     That they all are wanton wooers
     But the thrifty cottager,
     Who stirs little out of doors,
     Joys to spy thee near at home
     Spring is coming, thou art come

     Comfort have thou of thy merit,
     Kindly, unassuming spirit
     Careless of thy neighborhood,
     Thou dost show thy pleasant face
     On the moor, and in the wood,
     In the lane   ;
                       — there   's   not a place,
     Howsoever mean it be,
     But 't is good enough for thee.

       They have done as worldlings do,
       Taken praise that should be thine,

       Ill-requited upon earth
       Herald of a mighty band,
       Of a joyous train ensuing,
       Serving at my heart's command,
       Tasks that are no tasks renewing,
       I will sing, as doth behoove,
       Hymns in praise of what I love

Up with me up with me into the clouds
            !                               !




    For thy song, lark, is strong
Up with me up with me into the clouds
            !




         Singing, singing,
With clouds and sky about thee ringing,
    Lift me, guide me till I find
That spot which seems so to thy mind   !




I have walked through wildernesses dreary,
And to-day my heart is weary
Had I now the wings of a faery,
Up to thee would I fly.
There is madness about thee, and joy divine
In that song of thine   ;



Lift me, guide me high and high
To thy banqueting-place in the sky.

                     Joyous as morning,
     Thou art laughing and scorning
     Thou hast a nest for thy love and thy rest,
     And, though little troubled with sloth,
     Drunken lark thou wouldst be loth
                     !




     To be such a traveler as I.
     Happy, happy liver,
     With a soul as strong as a mountain river
     Pouring out praise to the Almighty Giver,
         Joy and jollity be with us both    !




     Alas!  my journey, rugged and uneven,
     Through prickly moors or dusty ways must wind
     But hearing thee, or others of thy kind,
     As full of gladness and as free of heaven,
     I,   with my fate contented, will plod on,
     And hope for higher raptures, when life's day is done.


                          SECOND POEM.

     Ethereal minstrel    pilgrim of the sky
                           !




     Dost thou despise the earth where cares abound ?
     Or, while the wings aspire, are heart and eye
     Both with thy nest upon the dewy ground ?
     Thy nest, which thou canst drop into at will,
     Those quivering wings composed, that music still.


     Leave to the nightingale her shady wood
     A privacy of glorious light is thine
     Whence thou dost pour upon the world a flood
     Of harmony, with instinct more divine      ;



     Type of the wise who soar, bat never roam
     True to the kindred points of Heaven and Home.

          TO A NIGHTINGALE.
   Nightingale    !   thou surely art
A creature of a " fiery heart " —   :




These notes of thine,     —
                         they pierce and pierce
Tumultuous harmony and fierce               !




Thou sing'st as if the God of wine
Had helped thee to a valentine          ;


A song in mockery and despite
Of shades, and dews, and silent night
And steady bliss, and all the loves
Now sleeping in these peaceful groves.
1 heard a stock-dove sing or say
His homely tale, this very day
His voice was buried among trees,
Yet to be come at by the breeze
                                   —
He did not cease but cooed and cooed
                  ;



And somewhat pensively he wooed                 :




He sang of love, with quiet blending,
Slow to begin, and never ending
Of serious faith, and inward glee
That was the song,    —the song for me              !




            TO THE CUCKOO.
       blithe new-comer       !   I have heard,
    1 hear thee and rejoice.
      Cuckoo shall I call thee bird,
              !




    Or but a wandering voice ?

    While I am lying on the grass
    Thy twofold shout I hear,
    From hill to hill it seems to pass,
    At once far off, and near.
80     SELECTED POEMS OF WORDSWORTH.

        Though babbling only to the vale,
        Of sunshine and of flowers,
        Thou bringest unto me a tale
        Of visionary hours.

        Thrice welcome, darling of the spring
        Even yet thou art to me
        No bird, but an invisible thing,
        A voice, a mystery        ;




        The same whom in my schoolboy days
        I listened to   ;
                            that cry
        Which made me look a thousand ways,
        In bush, and tree, and sky.

        To seek thee did I often rove
        Through woods and on the green
        And thou wert still a hope, a love
        Still longed for, never seen.


        And I can listen to thee yet
        Can lie upon the plain
        And listen, till I do beget
        That golden time again.

          blessed bird      !   the earth we pace
        Again appears to be
        An unsubstantial, faery place
        That is fit home for thee



     SHE WAS A PHANTOM OF DELIGHT.
      She was a phantom of delight
      Wlien first she gleamed upon my sight
      A lovely apparition, sent
      To be a moment's ornament:
           THKEE YEAES SHE GREW.                      81

    Her eyes as stars of twilight fair   ;


    Like twilight's, too, her dusky hair
    But all things else about her drawn
    From May-time and the cheerful dawn
    A dancing shape, an image gay,
    To haunt, to startle, and waylay.

    I saw her upon nearer view,
    A spirit, yet a woman too
    Her household motions light and free,
    And steps of virgin liberty
    A countenance in which did meet
    Sweet records, promises as sweet
    A creature not too bright or good
    For human nature's daily food;
    For transient sorrows, simple wiles,
    Praise, blame, love, kisses, tears, and smiles.


    And now I see with eye serene
    The very pulse of the machine
    A being breathing thoughtful breath,
    A traveler between life and death
    The reason firm, the temperate will,
    Endurance, foresight, strength, and skill
    A perfect woman, nobly planned,
    To warn, to comfort, and command
    And yet a spirit still, and bright
    With something of angelic light.

     " She shall be sportive as the fawn
     That wild with glee across the lawn
     Or up the mountain springs
     And hers shall be the breathing balm,
     And hers the silence and the calm
     Of mute, insensate things.

     " The floating clouds their state shall lend
     To her for her the willow bend
            ;



     Nor shall she fail to see,
     Even in the motions of the storm,
     Grace that shall mold the maiden's form
     By silent sympathy.

     " The stars of midnight shall be dear
     To her and she shall lean her ear

     In many a secret place
     Where rivulets dance their wayward round,

     Shall pass into her face.

     Shall rear her form to stately height,

Such thoughts to Lucy I will give
While she and I together live

Thus Nature spake.              — The work was done. —
How soon my Lucy's race was run
She died, and left to me
This heath, this calm and quiet scene
The memory of what has been,
And never more will be.

                 STEPPING WESTWARD.
  While my fellow-traveler and I were walking by the side of Loch
Ketterine, one fine evening after sunset, in our road to a hut where,
in the course of our tour, we  had been hospitably entertained some
weeks before, we met, in one of the loneliest parts of that solitary
region, two well-dressed women, one of whom said to us, by way of

greeting, " What, you are stepping westward ?

       " What, you are stepping westward ? "      — " Yea."
       — 'T would be a wildish destiny,
       If we, who thus together roam
       In a strange land, and far from home,
       Were in this place the guests of chance:
       Yet who would stop, or fear to advance,
       Though home or shelter he had none,
       With such a sky to lead him on ?

       The dewy ground was dark and cold
        Behind, all gloomy to behold
        And stepping westward seemed to be
        A kind of heavenly destiny     :
          THE SOLITARY REAPER.             85

I liked the greeting't was a sound
                         ;




Of something without place or bound;
And seemed to give me spiritual right
To travel through that region bright.

The voice was soft, and she who spake
Was walking by her native lake       :




The salutation had to me
The very sound of courtesy   :




Its power was felt  and while my eye
                     ;



Was fixed upon the glowing sky,
The echo of the voice inwrought
A human sweetness with the thought
Of traveling through the world that lay
Before me in my endless way.



       THE SOLITARY REAPER.
    Behold her, single in the field,
    Yon solitary Highland lass
    Reaping and singing by herself
    Stop here, or gently pass    !




    Alone she cuts and binds the grain,
    And sings a melancholy strain
    Oh, listen for the vale profound
              !




    Is overflowing with the sound.

    No nightingale did ever chant
    More welcome notes to weary bands
    Of travelers in some shady haunt,
    Among Arabian sands
    A voice so thrilling ne'er was heard
    In spring-time from the cuckoo-bird,
    Breaking the silence of the seas
    Among the farthest Hebrides.

          Will no one tell me what she sings ?            —
          Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow
          For old, unhappy, far-off things,
          And battles long ago    :

          Familiar matter of to-day ?
          Some natural sorrow, loss, or pain,
          That has been, and may be again ?

          Whate'er the theme, the maiden sang
          As if her song could have no ending;
          I saw her singing at her work,

     Earth has not anything to show more fair
     Dull would he be of soul who could pass by
     A sight so touching in its majesty
     This city now doth, like a garment, wear
     The beauty of the morning        ;   silent, bare,
     Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie
     Open unto the fields, and to the sky,
     All bright and glittering in the smokeless air.
     Never did sun more beautifully steep,
     In his first splendor, valley, rock, or hill
     Ne'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep
     The river glideth at his own sweet will

                         ;



   Smooth fields, white sheets of water, and pure sky
   I have thought of all by turns,and yet to lie
   Sleepless  and soon the small birds' melodies
                 !




   Must hear, first uttered from my orchard trees
   And the first cuckoo's melancholy cry.
   Even thus last night, and two rights more, I lay,
   And could not win thee, Sleep by any stealth       !




   So do not let me wear to-night away
   Without thee what is all the morning's wealth ?
   Come, blessed barrier between day and day,
   Dear mother of fresh thoughts and joyous health!


IT IS   A BEAUTEOUS EVENING, CALM AND
                                    FREE.
   It is a beauteous evening, calm and free,
   The holy time is quiet as a nun
   Breathless with adoration                    ;   the broad sun
   Is sinking down in its tranquillity                    ;



   The gentleness of heaven broods o'er the sea.
   Listen   !   the mighty Being is awake,
   And doth with his eternal motion make
   A sound like thunder — everlastingly.
   Dear child        !       dear girl   !   that walkest with me here,
   If thou appear untouched by solemn thought,
   Thy nature is not therefore less divine
   Thou liest in Abraham's bosom all the year
   And worship'st at the temple's inner shrine,
   God being with thee when we know it not.

                           SONNET.
     The world is too much with us   late and soon
                                         ;



     Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers:
     Little we see in Nature that is ours
     We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon
     This sea that bares her bosom to the moon      ;


     The winds that will be howling at all hours,
     And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers
     For this, for everything, we are out of tune
     It moves us not,   — Great God F d rather be
                                     !




     A pagan suckled in a creed outworn
     So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,
     Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn
     Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea,
     Or hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn.



                           SONNET.
     Most sweet it is with unuplifted eyes
     To pace the ground, if path be there or none,
     While a fair region round the traveler lies
     Which he forbears again to look upon
     Pleased rather with some soft ideal scene,
     The work of fancy, or some happy tone
     Of meditation, slipping in between
     The beauty coming and the beauty gone.
     If thought and love desert us, from that day
     Let us break off all commerce with the muse
     With thought and love companions of our way
     Whate'er the senses take or may refuse,
     The mind's internal heaven shall shed her dews
     Of inspiration on the humblest lay.
        A poet's epitaph.                                   89


      A POET'S EPITAPH.
Art thou a statist, in the van
Of public conflicts trained and bred ?
First learn to love one living man              ;



Then rnay'st thou think upon the dead.

A lawyer art thou ? — draw not nigh
Go, carry to some fitter place
The keenness of that practiced eye,
The hardness of that sallow face.

Art thou a man of purple cheer ?
A rosy man, right plump to see ?
Approach yet, doctor, not too near
              !                                     :




This grave no cushion is for thee.

Or art thou one of gallant pride,
A soldier and no man of chaff ?
Welcome   !       — but lay thy sword         aside,
And lean upon a peasant's staff.

Physician art thou ?          — one    all eyes,

Philosopher        !   — a fingering   slave,
One that would peep and botanize
Upon his mother's grave ?

Wrapt closely in thy sensual fleece,
Oh, turn aside,         —
                and take, I pray,
That he below may rest in peace,
Thy ever-dwindling soul away              !




A moralist perchance appears
Led, Heaven knows how             !   to this poor sod
And he has neither eyes nor ears
Himself his world, and his own God                      ;
90    SELECTED POEMS OF WORDSWORTH.

     One to whose smooth-rubbed soul can cling
     Nor form, nor feeling, great or small
     A reasoning, self-sufficing thing,
     An intellectual All-in-all

     Shut close the door press down the latch
                         ;



     Sleep in thy intellectual crust
     Nor lose ten tickings of thy watch
     Near this unprofitable dust.

     But who is he, with modest looks,
     And clad in homely russet-brown ?
     He murmurs near the running brooks
     A music sweeter than their own.

     He is retired as noontide dew,
     Or fountain in a noonday grove
     And you must love him, ere to you
     He will seem worthy of your love.

     The outward shows of sky and earth,
     Of hill and valley, he has viewed    ;


     And impulses of deeper birth
     Have come to him in solitude.

     In common things that round us lie
     Some random truths he can impart,
     The harvest of a. quiet eye,
     That broods and sleeps on his own heart.


     But he is weak both man and boy,
                     ;



     Hath been an idler in the land,
     Contented if he might enjoy
     The things which others understand.
EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF HOGG.          91

       — Come hither in thy hour of strength    ;



       Come, weak as is a breaking wave
       Here stretch thy body at full length
       Or build thy house upon this grave.


EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF
             JAMES HOGG.
     When first, descending from the moorlands,
     I saw the stream of Yarrow glide
     Along a bare and open valley,
     The Ettrick shepherd was my guide.

     When last along its banks I wandered,
     Through groves that had begun to shed
     Their golden leaves upon the pathways,
     My steps the border-minstrel led.
     The mighty minstrel breathes no longer,
     'Mid moldering ruins low he lies
     And death upon the braes of Yarrow
     Has closed the shepherd-poet's eyes
     Nor has the rolling year twice measured,
     From sign to sign, its steadfast course,
     Since every mortal power of Coleridge
     Was frozen at its marvelous source
     The rapt one, of the godlike forehead,
     The heaven-eyed creature sleeps in earth
     And Lamb, the frolic and the gentle,
     Has vanished from his lonely hearth.
     Like clouds that rake the mountain-summits,
     Or waves that own no curbing hand,
     How fast has brother followed brother,
     From sunshine to the sunless land
92        SELECTED POEMS OF WORDSWORTH.

       Yet I, whose lids from infant slumber
       Were earlier raised, remain to hear
       A timid voice, that asks in whispers,
       " Who next will drop and disappear ? n


       Our haughty life is crowned with darkness,
       Like London with its own black wreath,
       On which, with thee, Crabbe forth-looking,
                                        !




       I gazed from Hampstead's breezy heath.


       As if but yesterday departed,
       Thou too art gone before but why,
                                 ;



       O'er ripe fruit, seasonably gathered,
       Should frail survivors heave a sigh ?

       Mourn rather for that holy Spirit,
       Sweet as the spring, as ocean deep
       For her who, ere her summer faded,
       Has sunk into a breathless sleep.

       No more of old romantic sorrows,
       For slaughtered youth or lovelorn maid
       With sharper grief is Yarrow smitten,
       And Ettrick mourns with her their poet dead.


        RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.
     There was a roaring in the wind all night
     The rain came heavily and fell in floods
     But now the sun is rising calm and bright
     The birds are singing in the distant woods
     Over his own sweet voice the stock-dove broods
     The jay makes answer as the magpie chatters
     And all the air is filled with pleasant noise of waters,
       RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.                  93

All things that love the sun are out of doors
The sky rejoices in the morning's birth
The grass is bright with raindrops          —
                                      on the moors
                                        ;



The hare is running races in her mirth
And with her feet she from the plashy earth
Raises a mist   ;   that, glittering in the sun,
Runs with her all the way, wherever she doth run.

I was a traveler then upon the moor
I saw the hare that raced about with joy
I heard the woods and distant waters roar
Or heard them not, as happy as a boy
The pleasant season did my heart employ
My old remembrances went from me wholly
And all the ways of men, so vain and melancholy.

But, as it sometimes chanceth, from the might
Of joy in minds that can no further go,
As high as we have mounted in delight
In our dejection do we sink as low
To me that morning did it happen so
And fears and fancies thick upon me came
Dim sadness, and blind thoughts, I knew not, nor could
    name.

I heard the skylark warbling in the sky
And I bethought me of the playful hare
Even such a happy child of earth am I
Even as these blissful creatures do I fare
Far from the world I walk, and all from care
But there may come another day to me,           —
Solitude, pain of heart, distress, and poverty.


My whole life I have lived in pleasant thought,
As if life's business were a summer mood
As if all needful things would come unsought
94        SELECTED POEMS OF WORDSWORTH.

     To genial faith, still rich in genial good
     But how can he expect that others should
     Build for him, sow for him, and at his call
     Love him, who for himself will take no heed at all ?

     I thought of Chatterton, the marvelous boy,
     The sleepless soul that perished in his pride
     Of him who walked in glory and in joy,
     Following his plow, along the mountain-side
     By our own spirits we are deified   :




     We poets in our youth begin in gladness      ;


     But thereof come in the end despondency and madness.

     Now, whether it were by peculiar grace,
     A leading from above, a something given,
     Yet it befell, that, in this lonely place,
     When I with these untoward thoughts had striven,
     Beside a pool bare to the eye of heaven,
     I saw a man before me unawares
     The oldest man he seemed that ever wore gray hairs.

     As a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie
     Couched on the bald top of an eminence,
     Wonder to all who do the same espy,
     By what means it could thither come, and whence:
     So that it seems a thing endued with sense       ;
                                                              —
     Like a sea-beast crawled forth, that on a shelf
     Of rock or sand reposeth, there to sun itself        ;
                                                              —
     Such seemed this man, not all alive nor dead,
     Nor all asleep, in his extreme old age
     His body was bent double, feet and head
     Coming together in life's pilgrimage    ;


     As if some dire constraint of pain, or rage
     Of sickness felt by him in times long past,
     A more than human weight upon his frame had cast.
       RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.                   95

Himself he propped, limbs, body, and pale face,
Upon a long gray staff of shaven wood
And, still as I drew near with gentle pace,
Upon the margin of that moorish flood
Motionless as a cloud the old man stood,
That heareth not the loud winds when they call,
And moveth all together, if it move at all.

At length, himself unsettling, he the pond
Stirred with his staff, and fixedly did look
Upon that muddy water, which he conned,
As if he had been reading in a book
And now a stranger's privilege I took
And, drawing to his side, to him did say,
" This morning gives us promise of a glorious day."


A gentle answer did the old man make,
In courteous speech which forth he slowly drew
And him with further words I thus bespake
" What occupation do you there pursue ?
This is a lonesome place for one like you."
Ere he replied, a flash of mild surprise
Broke from the sable orbs of his yet vivid eyes.

His words came feebly, from a feeble chest,
But each in solemn order followed each,
With something of a lofty utterance drest,     —
Choice word and measured phrase, above the reach
Of ordinary men a stately speech
                 ;




Such as grave livers do in Scotland use,
Religious men, who give to God and man their dues.

He told, that to these waters he had come
To gather leeches, being old and poor
Employment hazardous and wearisome      !



And he had many hardships to endure
96        SELECTED POEMS OF WORDSWORTH.

     From pond to pond he roamed, from moor to moor
     Housing, with God's good help, by choice or chance
     And in this way he gained an honest maintenance.

     The old man still stood talking by my side
     But now his voice to me was like a stream
     Scarce heard nor word from word could I divide
                      ;



     And the whole body of the man did seem
     Like one whom I had met with in a dream
     Or like a man from some far region sent,
     To give me human strength, by apt admonishment.

     My former thoughts returned     :   the fear that kills
     And hope that is unwilling to be fed
     Cold, pain, and labor, and all fleshly ills
     And mighty poets in their misery dead.
     — Perplexed, and longing    to be comforted,
     My question eagerly did I renew,
     " How is it that you live, and what is it you do ? "


     He with a smile did then his words repeat
     And said, that, gathering leeches, far and wide
     He traveled stirring thus about his feet
                  ;




     The waters of the pools where they abide.
     " Once I could meet with them on every side

     But they have dwindled long by slow decay
     Yet still I persevere, and find them where I may."

     While he was talking thus, the lonely place,
     The old man's shape, and speech,      —
                                         all troubled me:

     In my mind's eye I seemed to see him pace
     About the weary moors continually,
     Wandering about alone and silently.
     W hile I these thoughts" within myself pursued,

And soon with this he other matter blended,
Cheerfully uttered, with demeanor kind,
But stately in the main        ;   and when he ended,
I could have laughed myself to scorn, to find
In that decrepit man so firm a mind.
" God," said I, " be my help and stay secure
                                                     "

Stern daughter of the Voice of God
  Duty if that name thou love,

Who art a light to guide, a rod
To check the erring, and reprove
Thou, who art victory and law
When empty terrors overawe,
From vain temptations dost set free,
And calm'st the weary strife of frail humanity

There are who ask not if thine eye
Be on them who, in love and truth,
                 ;



Where no misgiving is, rely
Upon the genial sense of youth
Glad hearts      !   without reproach or blot
Who do thy work, and know it not
Oh   !   if through confidence      misplaced
They fail, thy saving arms, dread Power          !   around them
         cast.


Serene will be our days and bright
And happy will our nature be,
When love is an unerring light,
And joy its own security.
And they a blissful course may hold

     Even now, who, not unwisely bold,
     Live in the spirit of this creed
     Yet seek thy firm support, according to their need.

     I,   loving freedom, and untried,
     No sport of every random gust,
     Yet being to myself a guide,
     Too blindly have reposed my trust
     And oft, when in my heart was heard
     Thy timely mandate, I deferred
     The task, in smoother walks to stray
     But thee I now would serve more strictly, if I may.

     Through no disturbance of my soul,
     Or strong compunction in me wrought,
     I supplicate for thy control
     But in the quietness of thought
     Me this unchartered freedom tires
     I feel the weight of chance-desires
     My hopes no more must change their name,
     I long for a repose that ever is the same.


     Stern Lawgiver       !   yet thou dost wear

     And fragrance in thy footing treads
     Thou dost preserve the stars from wrong
     And the most ancient heavens, through Thee, are fresh
            and strong.

     CHAEACTEE OF THE HAPPY WAEEIOE.
   Many elements of the character here portrayed were found in my
brother John,   who perished by shipwreck. His messmates used to
call him the Philosopher, from which it may be inferred that the quali-
ties and dispositions I allude to had not escaped their notice.     He
greatly valued moral and religious instruction for youth, as tending to
make good sailors.   The best, he used to say, came from Scotland     ;


the next to them, from the North of England, especially from West-
moreland and Cumberland, where, thanks to the piety and local attach-
ments of our ancestors, endowed, or, as they are called, free schools,
abound.

     Who is the happy Warrior ? Who is he
     That every man in arms should wish to be ?
     —     It is the generous spirit, who, when brought
     Among the tasks of real life, hath wrought
     Upon the plan that pleased his boyish thought
     Whose high endeavors are an inward light
     That makes the path before him always bright
     Who, with a natural instinct to discern
     W hat knowledge can perform,
       T
                                          is   diligent to learn
     Abides by this resolve, and stops not there,
     But makes his moral being his prime care
     Who, doomed to go in company with pain,
     And fear, and bloodshed, miserable train
     Turns his necessity to glorious gain
     In face of these doth exercise a power
     Which is our human nature's highest dower
     Controls them and subdues, transmutes, bereaves
     Of their bad influence, and their good receives         :

      By objects, which might force the soul to abate
      Her feeling, rendered more compassionate
      Is placable,   — because occasions   rise

      So often that demand such sacrifice
      More skillful in self-knowledge, even more pure,
      As tempted more more able to endure,
                          ;




      As more exposed to suffering and distress
      Thence, also, more alive to tenderness
      —  'T is he whose law is reason who depends

      Doth seldom on a right foundation rest
      He labors good on good to fix, and owes
      To virtue every triumph that he knows
      —  Who, if he rise to station of command,
      Rises by open means and there will stand
                                  ;




      On honorable terms, or else retire,
      And in himself possess his own desire       :




      Who comprehends his trust, and to the same
      Keeps faithful with a singleness of aim
      And therefore does not stoop, nor lie in wait
      For wealth, or honors, or for worldly state
      Whom they must follow, on whose head must fall,
      Like showers of manna, if they come at all
      Whose powers shed round him in the common strife,
      Or mild concerns of ordinary life,
      A constant influence, a peculiar grace
      But who, if he be called upon to face
      Some awful moment to which Heaven has joined
      Great issues, good or bad for human kind,
      Is happy as a lover and attired

In calmness made, and sees what he foresaw:
Or if an unexpected call succeed,
Come when it will, is equal to the need
— He who, though thus endued as with a sense
And faculty for storm and turbulence,
Is yet a soul whose master-bias leans
To homefelt pleasures and to gentler scenes
Sweet images which, wheresoe'er he be,
              !




Are at his heart and such fidelity

It is his darling passion to approve
More brave for this, that he hath much to love    :   —
'T is, finally, the man, who, lifted high,
Conspicuous object in a nation's eye,
Or left unthought of in obscurity,  —
Who, with a toward or untoward lot,
Prosperous or adverse, to his wish or not,
Plays, in the many games of life, that one
Where what he most doth value must be won     :




Whom neither shape of danger can dismay,
Nor thought of tender happiness, betray
Who, not content that former worth stand fast,
Looks forward, persevering to the last,
From well to better, daily self-surpast
Who, whether praise of him must walk the earth
Forever, and to noble deeds give birth,
Or he must fall, to sleep without his fame,
And leave a dead, unprofitable name,
Finds comfort in himself and in his cause
And, while the mortal mist is gathering, draws
His breath in confidence of heaven's applause,    —
This is the happy warrior this is he
                           ;




That every man in arms should wish to be.

            MY HEAET LEAPS UP.
        My heart leaps up when I behold
         A rainbow in the sky   :




        So was it when my life began ;
        So is it now I am a man
        So be it when I shall grow old,
          Or let me die    !




        The child is father of the man
        And I could wish my days to be
        Bound each to each by natural piety.


                THE FOUNTAIN.
                  A CONVERSATION.

      We talked with open heart, and tongue
      Affectionate and true,
      A pair of friends, though I was young,
      And Matthew seventy-two.

      We lay beneath a spreading oak,
      Beside a mossy seat
      And from the turf a fountain broke,
      And gurgled at our feet.
      " Now, Matthew " said I, " let us match
                       !




      This water's pleasant tune
      With some old border song, or catch
      That suits a summer's noon

      " Or of the church-clock and the chimes
      Sing here beneath the shade,
      That half-mad thing of witty rhymes
      Which you last April made     !
            THE FOUNTAIN.                       103

In silence Matthew lay, and eyed
The spring beneath the tree
And thus the dear old man replied,
The gray-haired man of glee

" No check, no stay, this streamlet fears   ;



How merrily it goes     !




'T will murmur on a thousand years,
And flow as now it flows.
" And here, on this delightful day,
I cannot choose but think
How oft, a vigorous man, I lay
Beside this fountain's brink.

" My eyes are dim with childish tears,
My heart is idly stirred,
For the same sound is in my ears
Which in those days I heard.

" Thus fares it still in our decay
And yet the wiser mind
Mourns less for what age takes away
Than what it leaves behind.

" The blackbird amid leafy trees,
The lark above the hill,
Let loose their carols when they please,
Are quiet when they will.

" With Nature never do they wage
A foolish strife they see
                ;



A happy youth, and their old age
Is beautiful and free       :




" But we are pressed by heavy laws
And often, glad no more,
104    SELECTED POEMS OF WORDSWORTH.

      We wear a face of joy, because
      We have been glad of yore.

      " If there be one who need bemoan
      His kindred laid in earth,
      The household hearts that were his own
      It is the man of mirth.


      " My days, my friend, are almost gone,
      My life has been approved,
      And many love me        ;       but by none
      Am I enough beloved."
      " Now both himself and me he wrongs,
      The man who thus complains
      I live and sing my idle songs
      Upon these happy plains

      " And, Matthew, for thy children dead
      F 11 be a son to thee "     !




      At this he grasped my hand, and said,
      " Alas   !   that cannot be."


      We rose up from the fountain-side
      And down the smooth descent
      Of the green sheep-track did we glide
      And through the wood we went

      And, ere we came to Leonard's rock,
      He sang those witty rhymes
      About the crazy old church-clock,
      And the bewildered chimes.

                                  ODE.

INTIMATIONS OF IMMORTALITY FROM RECOLLECTIONS OF
                 EARLY CHILDHOOD.

  This was composed during my residence at Town-end, Grasmere.
Two years, at least, passed between the writing of the four first stanzas
and the remaining part. To the attentive and competent reader the
whole sufficiently explains itself but there may be no harm in advert-
                                   ;



ing here to particular feelings or experiences of my own mind on which
the structure of the poem partly rests. Nothing was more difficult for
me in childhood than to admit the notion of death as a state applicable
to my own being.     I have said elsewhere   —
                               "A simple child,
                   That lightly draws its breath,
                   And feels its life in every limb,
                   What should it know of death " —       !




But it was not so much from feelings of animal vivacity that my diffi-
culty came as from a sense of the indomitableness of the Spirit within
me. I used to brood over the stories of Enoch and Elijah, and almost
persuade myself that, whatever might become of others, I should be
translated, in something of the same way, to heaven.   With a feeling
congenial to this, I was often unable to think of external things as
having external existence, and I communed with all that I saw as
something not apart from, but inherent in, my own immaterial nature.
Many times while going to school have I grasped at a wall or tree to
recall myself   from this abyss of idealism to the reality.    At that time
I was afraid of such processes.   In later periods of life I have deplored,
as we have all reason to do, a subjugation of an opposite character, and
have rejoiced over the remembrances, as is expressed in the lines    —
                          " Obstinate questionings
                   Of sense and outward things,
                   Fallings from us, vanishings "     ;       etc.

To that dream-like vividness and splendor which invest objects of sight
in childhood, every one, I believe, if    he would look back, could bear
testimony, and I need not dwell upon it here      but having in the poem
                                                  :

some good and pious persons, that I meant to inculcate such a belief.
It is far too shadowy a notion to be recommended to faith, as more
than an element in our instincts of immortality. But let us bear in
mind that, though the idea is not advanced in revelation, there is
nothing there to contradict it, and the fall of man presents an analogy
in its favor.   Accordingly, a pre-existent state has entered into the
popular creeds of many nations     and, among all persons acquainted
                                        ;



with classic literature, is known as an ingredient in Platonic philoso-
phy.   Archimedes said that he could move the world if he had a point
whereon to rest his machine. Who has not felt the same aspirations
as regards the world of his own mind ? Having to wield some of its
elements when I was impelled to write this poem on the " Immortality
of the Soul," I took hold of the notion of pre-existence as having suf-
ficient   foundation in humanity for authorizing me to            make for my
purpose the best use of it I could as a poet.

       There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream,
       The earth, and every common sight,
                  To me did seem
                     Appareled in celestial light,
       The glory and the freshness of a dream.
       It is not now as it hath been of yore ;                —
                     Turn wheresoe'er I may,

Now while the birds thus sing a joyous song,
     And while the young lambs bound
        As to the tabor's sound,
To me alone there came a thought of grief
A timely utterance gave that thought relief,
          And I again am strong
The cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep
No more shall grief of mine the season wrong
I hear the echoes through the mountains throng,
The winds come to me from the fields of sleep,

Yearnings she hath in her own natural kind,
And, even with something of a mother's mind,

To make her foster-child, her inmate man,

Behold the child among his new-born blisses,
A six years' darling of a pigmy size
See, where 'mid work of his own hand he lies,
Fretted by sallies of his mother's kisses,
With light upon him from his father's eyes
See, at his feet, some little plan or chart,
Some fragment from his dream of human life,
Shaped by himself with newly-learned art
      A wedding or a festival,
      A mourning or a funeral
         And this hath now his heart,
       And unto this he frames his song
         Then will he fit his tongue
To dialogues of business, love, or strife
       But it will not be long
       Ere this be thrown aside,
       And with new joy and pride
The little actor cons another part
Filling from time to time his "humorous stage"
With all the persons, down to palsied age,
That life brings with her in her equipage
       As if his whole vocation
       Were endless imitation.

withering put the subject into my thoughts, and I wrote with the hope

And she expects the issue in repose.

O terror what hath she perceived ? — joy

      But in reward of thy fidelity.                                40

      For fearless virtue bringeth boundless gain.

Come, blooming hero, place thee by my side

Rebellious passion   :   for the gods approve
The depth, and not the tumult, of the soul                        75

A fervent, not ungovernable, love.
Thy transports moderate          ;   and meekly mourn
When I depart, for brief is my sojourn — "

" Ah, wherefore ?   — did not Hercules by force
Wrest from the guardian monster of the tomb                       80

Alcestis, a reanimated corse,
Given back to dwell on earth in vernal bloom ?
Medea's spells dispersed the weight of years,
And iEson stood a youth 'mid youthful peers.

COMPOSED A FEW MILES ABOVE TINTERN ABBEY, ON REVISIT-
  ING THE BANKS OF THE WYE DURING A TOUR. JULY 13,
   1798.

   No poem of mine was composed under circumstances more pleasant
for me to remember than this.                I began it      upon leaving Tintern, after
crossing the Wye, and concluded                it       just as I was entering Bristol in
the evening, after a ramble of four or five days, with my sister.                     Not
a line of it was altered, and not any part of                     it written   down till I
reached Bristol.      It   was published almost immediately after in the
little volume,   called Lyrical Ballads.


        Five years have passed; five summers, with the length
        Of five long winters and again I hear
                                       !




        These waters, rolling from their mountain-springs
        With a soft inland murmur. 1 Once again          —
        Do I behold these steep and lofty cliffs,
        That on a wild, secluded scene impress
        Thoughts of more deep seclusion and connect           ;




        The landscape with the quiet of the sky.
        The day is come when I again repose
       Here, under this dark sycamore, and view
       These plots of cottage-ground, these orchard-tufts,
       Which at this season, with their unripe fruits,
       Are clad in one green hue, and lose themselves
       'Mid groves and copses. Once again I see
       These hedge-rows, hardly hedge-rows, little lines
       Of sportive wood run wild these pastoral farms,
                                                    :

      Green to the very door and wreaths of smoke
                               ;



      Sent up, in silence, from among the trees
      With some uncertain notice, as might seem
      Of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods,
      Or of some hermit's cave, where by his fire
      The hermit sits alone.
                                       These beauteous forms,
      Through a long absence, have not been to me
      As is a landscape to a blind man's eye
      But oft, in lonely rooms, and 'mid the din
      Of towns and cities, I have owed to them,
      In hours of weariness, sensations sweet,
      Felt in the blood, and felt along the heart
      And passing even into my purer mind,
      With tranquil restoration             —

      On that best portion of a good man's life,
      His little, nameless, unremembered acts
      Of kindness and of love. Nor less, I trust,
      To them I may have owed another gift,
      Of aspect more sublime that blessed mood,
                                   ;



      In which the burden of the mystery,
      In which the heavy and the weary weight
      Of all this unintelligible world,
      Is lightened   :
                         —
                      that serene and blessed mood,
      In which the affections gently lead us on,          —
      Until, the breath of this corporeal frame
      And even the motion of our human blood
      Almost suspended, we are laid asleep
      In body, and become a living soul
      While with an eye made quiet by the power
      Of harmony, and the deep power of joy,
      We see into the life of things.

Be but a vain belief, yet, oh how oft!
                                         —
In darkness and amid the many shapes
Of joyless daylight; when the fretful stir
Unprofitable, and the fever of the world,
Have hung upon the beatings of my heart      —
How oft, in spirit, have I turned to thee,
  sylvan Wye thou wanderer thro' the woods,
                  !




How often has my spirit turned to thee
  And now, with gleams of half-extinguished thought,
With many recognitions dim and faint,
And somewhat of a sad perplexity,
The picture of the mind revives again    :




W'hile here I stand, not only with the sense
Of present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughts
That in this moment there is life and food
For future years. And so I dare to hope,
Though changed, no doubt, from what I was when first
1 came among these hills   when like a roe
                             ;


I bounded o'er the mountains, by the sides
Of the deep rivers, and the lonely streams,
Wherever nature led more like a man
                      :




Flying from something that he dreads, than one
Who sought the thing he loved.   For nature then
(The coarser pleasures of my boyish days,
And their glad animal movements all gone by)
To me was all in all. —I cannot paint
What then I was. The sounding cataract
Haunted me like a passion the tall rock,
                                 ;




The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,
Their colors and their forms, were then to me
An appetite   a feeling and a love,
              ;



That had no need of a remoter charm,
By thought supplied, nor any interest
Unborrowed from the eye.         —
                              That time is past,
And all its aching joys are now no more,

      And all its dizzy raptures.             Not for this
      Faint I, nor mourn nor murmur               ;       other gifts
      Have followed; for such loss, I would believe,
      Abundant recompense. For I have learned
      To look on nature, not as in the hour
      Of thoughtless youth but hearing oftentimes
                                    ;



      The still, sad music of humanity,
      Nor harsh, nor grating, though of ample power
      To chasten and subdue. And I have felt
      A presence that disturbs me with the joy
      Of elevated thoughts a sense sublime
                                    ;



      Of something far more deeply interfused,
      Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,
      And the round ocean and the living air,
      And the blue sky, and in the mind of man                     ;



      A motion and a spirit, that impels
      All thinking things, all objects of all thought,
      And rolls through all things.              Therefore am I still
      A lover of the meadows and the woods,
      And mountains and of all that we behold
                        ;



      From this green earth of all the mighty world
                                        ;




      Of eye, and ear,      —
                       both what they half create, 1
      And what perceive well pleased to recognize
                                ;

                                            Nor perchance,
      If I were not thus taught, should I the more
      Suffer my genial spirits to decay               :




      For thou art with me here upon the banks
      Of this fair river thou my dearest friend,

My former pleasures in the shooting lights
Of thy wild eyes. Oh yet a little while

May I behold in thee what I was once,
My dear, dear sister      !       and this prayer I make,
Knowing that nature never did betray
The heart that loved her 't is her privilege,
                                      ;



Through all the years of this our life, to lead
From joy to joy   :   for she can so inform
The mind that is within us, so impress
With quietness and beauty, and so feed
With lofty thoughts, that neither evil tongues,
Rash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish men,
Nor greetings where no kindness is, nor all
The dreary intercourse of daily life,
Shall e'er prevail against us or disturb
Our cheerful faith, that all which we behold
Is full of blessings.         Therefore let the moon
Shine on thee in thy solitary walk
And let the misty mountain-winds be free
To blow against thee: and, in after years,
When these wild ecstasies shall be matured
Into a sober pleasure         ;   when thy mind
Shall be a mansion for all lovely forms,
Thy memory be as a dwelling-place
For all sweet sounds and harmonies                 ;   oh   !   then,
If solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief,
Should be thy portion, with what healing thoughts
Of tender joy wilt thou remember me,
And these my exhortations                 !   Nor, perchance,      —
If I should be where I no more can hear

      A worshiper of nature, hither came
      Unwearied in that service    :   rather say
      With warmer love,  —  oh with far deeper zeal
                               !




      Of holier love. Nor wilt thou then forget,
      That after many wanderings, many years
      Of absence, these steep woods and lofty cliffs,
      And this green pastoral landscape, were to me
      More dear, both for themselves and for thy sake   !

                    THE EXCURSION — BOOK I.
  Line 2.    "Landscape."                     Altered from the old landskip, as used by
Tennyson     in    "The Princess,"                 Bk. IV.    German landschaft.      The
English scape is from the Anglo-Saxon scapen, to shape.
  Line 3.    "Downs."                  From a Celtic word, dun, a hill of moderate
elevation.
             " She went by dale and she went by down." (Tennyson.)

  Line 5.    "Dappled."                    Covered with spots.
                        '
                            '   Oft on the dappled turf at ease
                                I sit,      and play at similes. '




                                                    (Wordsworth, "To the Daisy.")

  Line 6. "Brooding." From an Old English word, bredan, allied
with the Saxon bredan, to keep warm, to nourish. It suggests the
German brod, bread.
  Line 11.        "Ceiling."                Early forms, cyling, siling, syling : hangings
from above one's head              ;       hence any overhead surface.

                             and now the thickening sky

                                       '



                      Like a dark ceiling stood."
                                            ("Paradise Lost," XL 742.)

  Line 15.        " Side-long."               Note Scott's use of the word    :
                                                                                  —
                                               " His frantic chase
                      Sidelong he turns, and now 't is bent
                      Right up the rock's tall battlement."
                                                                     ("Rokeby," II. 14.)
  Line 29. " Brotherhood," etc. A figure used by this poet in other
poems, as in "Sonnet composed at         Castle," where the words
"brotherhood of venerable trees " occur.
  Line 34. " Hale." Anglo-Saxon hdl = whole.
                                                    125
126                                NOTES.

  Line 53. "Antique market-village." Reference to Hawkshead,
where the poet passed his school days (1779-1787).
  Line 55. " Drew," i.e. withdrew.
  Line 05. " Abstrusest." Used here in a literal sense. Concealed,
thrust out of sight, as in " Don Quixote,"     —
                                             " Hidden in the most ab-
struse dungeons of Bombay " (I. iv. 15).
  Line 68. "A skillful, "etc. Suggests Shakespeare's familiar phrase,
" Concord of sweet sounds."     (" Merchant of Venice," V. 1.)
  Line 77. " Many are the poets." From the Greek 71-01777-7^, a maker.
Elsewhere (" Personal Traits") Wordsworth has described the mission
of
                " The poets, who on earth have made us heirs
                 Of truth and pure delight by heavenly lays.   '




     Line 78.    " Men endowed."     The familiar saying, " Poets are born,
not made," is thus corrected by Ben Jonson         :
                                                       —
                  " For a good poet's made as well as born."
                                   ("To the Memory of Shakespeare.")
Note Wordsworth's further thought in line 80.
  Line 81. "Docile season." Points to the age when the mind is
easily taught.
     Line 84.     "Temper too severe."     A certain seriousness of mind
that hampered the free flow of thought in song.
     Line 85.    "A nice backwardness afraid of shame."       " Nice " = dis-
criminating, highly critical.      The poet marks here an oversensitive
shrinking from ridicule.
     Line 87.   "Unto the height," i.e. to the full measure of their ability.
     Line 90.    " Husbanding."    From the Anglo-Saxon husbonda, mas-
ter of the house.

                  " For my means, I'll husband them so well,
                   They shall go far."    (Shakespeare.)

  Line 94. "Graces." Mental endowments. It may also include
embellishments of literary style.
  Line 95. "Inward light." Poetic insight.
  Line 100. " Feeling pleasures." The poet here describes the soul-
ful emotions that throb within this man of poetic genius, while he
dwells apart from the busy and noisy world.
   Line 104. "Venerable nature." More suggestive and impressive
than the word " old." Macaulay speaks of " the venerable stream."
  Line 106. "Deliberately pleased." The poet here pays gracious

tribute to the    Muse, who inspires his pen, and who thoughtfully and
considerately approves his work.
  Line 108.     "Athol."   A district in Perthshire County, Scotland.                         It
is 450   square miles in extent.The county itself is the fourth in size
in Scotland and surpasses all the other counties in picturesqueness and
variety of scenery.
  Line 113.      "Austere."   This word should not be understood in its
ordinary sense,   — harsh, severe but
                                   ;       strict, firm.           The reader will note
how full and vivid is the poet's description of a typical Scotch home.
  Line 121. "Long-continuing winter." In reading this line one is
reminded of the winter season in New England, which "lingering,
chills the lap of May."
  Line 122.      "Satchel."   From the Latin saccas, a bag.                      "Nyle ze
bere a sachel, neither scrip."     (Wyclif.)
  Line 125.      "Minster."    From monos, alone;                      to live in solitude.
Originally a minster was a monastery            ;   later the church belonging to
a monastery.  As many such churches became cathedrals, the word is
now used of any cathedral church having such an origin.'
  Line 128. " Grow larger in the darkness." Allusion is here made
to the well-known fact that in the semi-darkness of evening the                              dim
outlines of surrounding objects are magnified to the eye.
  Line 133.      "Communion." Communion with nature is a favorite
theme with the poets.    Matthew Arnold writes             :
                                                               —
                " Calm soul of all things   !       make it mine
                    To feel, amid the city's jar,
                  That there abides a peace of thine
                    Man did not make, and cannot mar."
  Line 134.      "Long before his time," i.e. earlier in life than one
would naturally expect.
  Line 136.       "Deep feelings," etc., a twofold statement of a single
thought.   Our feelings interpret the presence and dominant action of
deep thoughts. "External things produced in him such intense feel-
ings that he came to regard these impressions as the sole realities,
while the very senses though which alone they came appeared sources
of obstruction and illusion."
                                     " Such a holy calm
               Would overspread my soul that bodily eyes
               Were utterly forgotten and what I saw
                                       ;


               Appeared like something in myself, a dream,
               A prospect of the mind."
                                     ( Wordsworth    The Prelude.  '                 '
                                                               ,       '
                                                                                         '

  Line 145.            " Active power,"      i.e.   the power of holding in memory,
as contrasted with the involuntary capacity for receiving impressions.
  Line 157.           "   A peculiar eye," i.e. clear, definite, fixed a vision that
                                                                            ;



sees afar.
  Line 101. "An ehbing and a flowing mind." Notice the graphic
and forcible manner in which the poet makes even the rocks, with
their ever varying hues, to shape the changing moods of his mind.
  Line 167.           "Apprehensive."       Alert, quick to grasp the meaning of
life and the moral relationships and measures of visible forces.

  Line 172. " The life and death of martyrs." It is probable that
Wordsworth had in mind "Fox's Book of Martyrs," which appeared
in 1563.   This book was read in all the homes of Scotland. Its
author was a devout and earnest defender of the faith, who was born
in Boston, Lincolnshire, 1516, and died in London, 1587.
  Line 175. "Covenant." The author here refers to the persecutions
of the seventeenth century in Scotland, which grew out of the refusal
of the people to accept the Liturgy imposed upon them by Charles I.
The Scottish Covenant was a bold statement of the views of the Pres-
byterians, to which they vowed adherence even unto death.
  Line 178.           "A straggling volume," i.e. a stray roll          ;       volume from
volvo, to roll.
  Line 181      .
                      " Garniture."     Anything that furnishes or adorns. "The
finest garnitures of art."            (Addison.)  Here used by the poet to mean
illustrations of a weird sort.
  Line 187.            "Wanting yet the pure delight of love."                     The poet
alludes to his belief that nature teaches the love of God.                        He carries
over into nature his            own consciousness of an ever existent Creator,
and makes His pervading presence a divine reality. Wordsworth was
not a Pantheist, but he believed in an intimate interrelation between
God and nature.
  Line 188.           "The breathing air," i.e. the pulsating, palpitating air.
The poet sees in the very atmosphere about him evidence of almost
human consciousness.
  Line 201.  "The solid frame of earth."                        Suggests Shakespeare's
words   :
            —
                    " This goodly frame, the earth."        (" Hamlet," II. 2.)


  Line 207.           " Sensation, soul, and form. "       " Sensation " refers to the
subtle pleasure produced by the gentler offices of nature, in the delicate
fragrance of the flowers and the soft zephyrs " form," to the engag-
                                                            ;



ing pictures of mountain scenery, the sunsets,                   etc.   "Soul" is the

spirit that animates all and brings the entire realm of   nature close to
the heart of man.
  Line 211.      " Access of mind."   Increase of mental force.
  Line 213.      "Thought was not."    The currents of feeling ran so
deep as to allow little chance for thought.
  Line 221. " Possessed.'''' Taken possession of entranced. " I have
                                                   ;



been touched, yea, and possessed with an extreme wonder at those
four virtues."     (Bacon.)
  Line 225.      "The mystery."  Keference to such Biblical passages
as Mark iv. 11, " Unto you is given to know the mystery of the king-
dom of God."   See also 1 Cor. ii. 7 and Eph. iii. 9.
  Lines 226-232. This noble passage is representative of Words-
worth's exaltation of nature as the interpreter of the Deity.     Nature
makes one feel God and immortality.      The Scriptures inspire one with
reverence for the Infinite.
  Line 237.      "Ecstasies."   The mind is pictured as being removed
from its normal bearings, lifted up.    Astonishment and wonder rule
in the observer's soul.
  Line 243.   "A superstitious eye." Love in her intensity makes
even superstition subserve her ends.
  Line 249. " That mighty orb of song." In Wordsworth's sonnet
to Milton are other evidences of his admiration.

               " Thy soul was like a star and dwelt apart."

  Line 250. "Lore." From Anglo-Saxon lav, teaching, learning.
These words are used interchangeably in some parts of England.
  Line 253. " The purer elements. " As distinct from the complex,
as pure abstract mathematics is distinguished from that which is
mixed or applied.
  Line 254. "Charm severe." A fascination which was still depend-
ent on hard study.
  Line 277. "Visionary sides." The lofty peak is a reminder of
past events, requiring in the beholder visions of the imagination to
reproduce them.
  Line 279. "The path of fire." The lightning stroke leaving be-
hind it indistinct traces of its course.
  Line 292.      "From the stillness of abstracted thought."      In the
quiet hours of the night, when every sound seems unnaturally magni-
fied,   he sought relief to his turbulent mind by engaging in abstract
meditation.
  Lines 293-297.      These exquisite effects produced by the sunlight

falling on ascending mist are seen          below the Falls of Niagara, where
the rainbow makes a complete circle.
  Line 307.     "The well of homely life."           The domestic life of all
nations was a very fascinating study to Wordsworth.               The word
" homely " is used here as in Gray's " Elegy "            :
                                                              —
                " Their homely joys and destiny obscure."

  Line 317.   "Savoyard." Savoy, the loftiest mountain region of
Europe.  Northward is the Lake of Geneva eastward, Piedmont in
                                                      ;



France.   The Swiss cantons, with their memories of William Tell
and Arnold Winkelried, are eloquent of struggle and liberty.
  Line 330. "Sequestration." From the Latin sequester, an arbi-
trator. To sequester was to set aside for arbitration. The word finally
came to mean simply to set aside. Wordsworth uses the word in one
of his sonnets.
                                    '
                                        '   The sacred book
                  In dusty sequestration wrapt too long."

  Line 346.     "Exist more simple in their elements."                  This poet did
not accept some of the      scientific       claims of his day.          The phrase,
"modern civilization," was not congenial to his thought.
  Line 359.     "No piteous revolutions."           Wordsworth no doubt re-
ferred to the horrors of the French Revolution.                   This great crisis in
French history made a profound impression upon him.
  Line 370.  "Afford to suffer." Used here in the sense of having
the capacity to endure sympathetic pain.
  Line 397.     "The Scottish Church."      The Church of Scotland is
Presbyterian,     made up of three bodies, the Established Church, the
Free Church, and the United Presbyterian Church.
  Line 399. " Purity." The term " Puritan " was originally applied
in reproach.  The poet here seeks to reclaim the word, referring to
the quality of the religious belief of the people.
  Line 408. " Melted all away." Reference here to the fact that the
austerity of Puritanism was displaced by the sweetness of his life.
  Line 425.     " Breathed intelligence."

              "Bright-eyed fancy, hov'ring o'er,
                Scatters from her pictured urn
                Thoughts that breathe and words that burn."                 (Gray.)

  Line 490. " Mortal stillness." The picture in the poet's mind is
water so motionless as to remind one of death.

  To this poem Wordsworth prefixes a verse from George Wither, an
English poet of some note. He was born in Brentworth, Hampshire,
June 11, 1588, and died in London, May 2, 1667. For issuing the poem,
"Abuses Stript and Whipt," he was imprisoned. His active partici-
pation in the Civil War, and his loyalty to Cromwell, occasioned him
much abuse and suffering.
  In the verse from Wither, with which the poet introduced this
poem, "Titan" is used of the sun, the name being substituted for
the Greek Helios, god of the sun.
