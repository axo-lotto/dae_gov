        Eternal objects are pure potentials for the determination of fact.
        They are not actual but can be actualized in concrete occasions.
        Colors, shapes, emotions, concepts - all are eternal objects that
        gain definite instantiation through prehension.

        An eternal object can be prehended in two modes: physically (as
        already actualized in some datum) or conceptually (as a pure
        possibility for becoming). Conceptual prehension is the origin
        of novelty - the introduction of potentials not fully realized
        in the past.

        The realm of eternal objects provides a vast space of alternative
        possibilities for each occasion. The subjective aim selects which
        potentials to actualize, guided by relevance to satisfaction.

        In organizational contexts, eternal objects are the unrealized
        potentials - new ways of relating, untried patterns of governance,
        imagined futures. Prehending these conceptually opens pathways
        for transformation beyond what has been.
