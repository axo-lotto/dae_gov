        The I Ching is grounded in the interplay of yin (⚋) and yang (⚊):

        Yang (⚊): The creative, active, firm, light, ascending
        Yin (⚋): The receptive, passive, yielding, dark, descending

        This is NOT dualism (opposing forces) but dynamic complementarity:
        - Each contains the seed of the other
        - Transformation arises from their interaction
        - Neither is superior; both are necessary

        In organizational trauma work:
        - Yang: Action, intervention, naming, confronting
        - Yin: Listening, witnessing, allowing, receiving

        In process philosophy:
        - Yang: Subjective aim, concrescence, creativity
        - Yin: Objective givenness, perishing, receptivity

        In BAGUA tuning (DAE 3.0):
        - Yang trigrams activate when hypothesis space needs expansion
        - Yin trigrams activate when consolidation is needed
        - Balance emerges from context-sensitive modulation
