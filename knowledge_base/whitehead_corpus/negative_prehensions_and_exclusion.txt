        Not all prehensions are positive. An occasion can negatively prehend
        data, excluding it from its final satisfaction. This is not mere
        absence but an active rejection that still shapes the becoming.

        Negative prehensions are necessary for definiteness. An occasion
        cannot include everything; it must exclude to achieve a determinate
        form. What is rejected still influences by its absence - it marks
        boundaries, defines contrasts, creates space for what is included.

        The subjective aim guides which prehensions are positive and which
        are negative. This selective inclusion/exclusion is the basis of
        valuation: some data are felt as relevant, others as irrelevant or
        antagonistic to the aim.

        In trauma-informed work, negative prehensions correspond to defensive
        exclusion - parts of experience that are too painful or threatening
        to integrate. Healing involves transforming negative prehensions
        into positive ones, expanding what can be felt and included.
