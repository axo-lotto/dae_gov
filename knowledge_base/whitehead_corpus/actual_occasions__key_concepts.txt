        The actual entity is the real concrescence of many potentials.
        It is a process of becoming, not a static substance.
        Each actual occasion arises from its prehensions of prior occasions,
        synthesizing the many into a novel unity.

        Prehension is the concrete fact of relatedness. An actual occasion
        prehends other occasions as given, as data for its own self-creation.
        There is physical prehension (feeling of feeling) and conceptual
        prehension (feeling of eternal objects as pure potentials).

        Concrescence is the process by which the many become one through
        synthesis. It is not imposed from without but emerges from within
        through the subjective aim guiding the occasion toward satisfaction.

        Satisfaction is the final phase of concrescence, where the becoming
        achieves definiteness. The occasion is now fully determinate and can
        serve as datum for successor occasions. It perishes as subject but
        remains as object for future becoming.

        Creativity is the universal of universals, the principle by which
        the many become one and are increased by one. Each act of concrescence
        adds genuine novelty to the universe.
