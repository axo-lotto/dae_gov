I have a good job and a nice house but I feel a deep restlessness like there is something essential missing. I keep asking myself is this all there is? Not in a depressed way but in a genuinely curious way. I want the second half of my life to be more intentional more aligned with my deeper values. But I do not even know what those values are anymore. I have been so busy surviving and achieving that I never stopped to ask what I actually want.

I am angry at the patriarchy for teaching me to silence myself. I am angry at my parents for not letting me have the full range of human emotions. I am angry at myself for all the times I did not speak up when I should have. This anger feels powerful and scary at the same time. It has been buried so long it does not know how to come out properly. I need help learning how to be angry in healthy ways.",

I am not naive enough to think everything will be perfect but I am starting to believe that good things can happen again.
