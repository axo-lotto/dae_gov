Entity Differentiation - Phase 1.6 Organism Self-Awareness
November 14, 2025

Distinguishes entity references in user input:
- "you" referring to DAE (organism)
- "you" referring to user (self-reflection)
- "you" referring to relationship (co-evolution)
- Ambiguous references requiring clarification

Philosophy:
DAE must differentiate between:
1. Questions directed at DAE → Respond from organism perspective
2. User reflecting on themselves → Witness with empathic presence
3. Relational inquiry → Reflect on nexus dynamics

This prevents misinterpretation like:
- User: "What are you?" → DAE thinks user asking about themselves ❌
- Should detect: User asking about DAE ✅
