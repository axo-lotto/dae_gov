                         Template Analysis Complete
================================================================================

PROJECT: Multi-Domain AGI System (ARC Prize 2025, Sudoku, Therapeutic AI)
STATUS: ✅ ANALYSIS COMPLETE - Ready for Implementation
DATE: November 7, 2025

================================================================================
WHAT WAS ANALYZED
================================================================================

DAE_HYPHAE_0 - A 7.7 MB clean extraction of DAE 3.0 AXO ARC organic learning
system, ready to serve as template for domain adaptation.

ANALYSIS SCOPE:
✓ Directory structure (16 directories, multiple subdirectories)
✓ Component inventory (16 Python files, 7,599 lines)
✓ Data structures (6 JSON databases, 697 KB)
✓ Dependencies (only 2 external packages!)
✓ Configuration parameters (80+ in CARD organ)
✓ Training scripts and data loading
✓ Performance metrics and learning mechanisms

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS

   - All core systems are domain-independent
   - Only training scripts need customization

   - Core system: 2,379 lines (universal, no changes needed)
   - Transductive system: 4,571 lines (universal, no changes needed)
   - Training scripts: 855 lines (domain-specific, must adapt)
   - Only ~280 lines need modification per domain!

3. DEPENDENCIES ARE MINIMAL ✅
   - numpy >= 1.24.0
   - scipy >= 1.10.0
   - NO TensorFlow, PyTorch, or ML frameworks
   - All algorithms implemented from scratch

4. DATA STRUCTURES ARE PORTABLE ✅
   - 6 JSON databases (pure JSON, domain-independent)
   - Fractal reward system works for any domain
   - Hebbian memory adaptable to any patterns
   - Organism state is universal

5. VALIDATION IS PROVEN ✅
   - Tested on 1,400 ARC tasks
   - 841 perfect tasks (60.1%)
   - 47.3% success rate (validated architectural ceiling)
   - Zero degradation across 5 epochs (29 hours)

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

USE OPTION A: CLONE TEMPLATE (Immediate)

Rationale:
- ARC Prize 2025 is time-sensitive
- Cloning takes 2-3 hours per domain
- Each domain needs independent evaluation metrics
- Can refactor to shared core later if needed

Implementation:
1. Clone for Sudoku: cp -r DAE_HYPHAE_0 DAE_SUDOKU_0
2. Clone for Therapeutic: cp -r DAE_HYPHAE_0 DAE_THERAPEUTIC_0
3. Customize data loaders per domain (2-3 hours each)
4. Test on 5 tasks per domain (1 hour each)
5. Measure baseline performance

Timeline:
- Setup: 8-10 hours total
- Per-domain training: 3-5 hours each

Alternative (POST-COMPETITION):
- OPTION B: Shared Core Architecture (refactor to dae_core/)
- Effort: 6-8 hours + 2-3 hours per domain
- Benefit: Single source of truth, cross-domain learning

CRITICAL NUMBERS
================================================================================

TEMPLATE SIZE:
  Total: 7.7 MB
  Python: 7,599 lines
  Core system: 2,379 lines (universal)
  Transductive: 4,571 lines (universal)
  Training: 855 lines (domain-specific)

PERFORMANCE (ARC):
  Perfect tasks: 841 (60.1% of 1,400)
  Success rate: 47.3% ± 0.1pp (VALIDATED ceiling)
  Global confidence: 1.000 (sustained)
  Cross-dataset transfer: 86.75% (ARC 1.0 → 2.0)
  Training stability: Zero degradation (5 epochs)

EFFORT ESTIMATES:
  Clone per domain: 2-3 hours
  Total setup (2 domains): 8-10 hours
  Long-term refactor: 6-8 hours

EXPECTED PERFORMANCE (Phase 1):
  ARC: 47.3% (done)
  Sudoku: 50-65% estimated
  Therapeutic: 30-45% estimated

================================================================================
WHAT WORKS EXCEPTIONALLY WELL
================================================================================

✅ Organic self-organization (37 families emerged naturally)
✅ Fractal reward propagation (7-level cascade validated)
✅ Cross-dataset transfer (86.75% knowledge retention)
✅ Training stability (zero degradation across 5 epochs)
✅ Minimal dependencies (only numpy + scipy)
✅ Whiteheadian process philosophy (computational substrate)
✅ Hebbian learning (3,500+ patterns, saturated)

================================================================================
WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
================================================================================

⚠️ Grid-based representation (ARC-specific)
   - Cannot handle continuous transforms (1.5×, 2.7× scaling)
   - Cannot handle topological operations (tears, merges)
   - 76% failure rate on scaling tasks
   Mitigation: For Sudoku, use constraint solver

⚠️ Single-pass processing
   - Cannot iterate on partial solutions
   - Cannot decompose 4+ step tasks
   - 62% failure rate on composition tasks
   Mitigation: For Therapy, implement multi-turn handling

⚠️ Memorization-based learning
   - Weak on novel pattern generalization
   - 54% failure rate on novel assignments
   Mitigation: For Therapy, use semantic understanding

⚠️ Hardcoded paths (3 locations)
   - Fixed with one sed command during cloning
   - See QUICK_CLONE_REFERENCE.md for exact command
