## Tunable Parameters Review

### Current Settings (Production-Ready)

**V0 Convergence:**
```python
max_cycles = 5                    # Maximum convergence iterations
convergence_threshold = 0.1       # Energy change threshold
kairos_window = [0.45, 0.70]     # Kairos detection window
satisfaction_threshold = 0.9      # Satisfaction-based convergence
```

**Emission Generation:**
```python
direct_threshold = 0.65           # Direct emission threshold
fusion_threshold = 0.50           # Fusion emission threshold
meta_atom_direct_threshold = 0.30 # Meta-atom direct threshold
transduction_confidence_base = 0.70  # Healing pathway base
```

**Salience Model:**
```python
trauma_inflation_threshold = 0.75  # High signal inflation
trauma_temporal_threshold = 0.70   # Temporal collapse
safety_gradient_low = 0.50         # Low safety threshold
morphogenetic_pressure_threshold = 0.60  # Morphogenetic activation
```

### Recommended Tuning for Kairos Detection

**Current Issue:** 0% Kairos detection rate

**Diagnosis:** Kairos window too narrow (0.45-0.70) given current V0 descent patterns (final V0: 0.096-0.169)

**Recommended Adjustments:**
```python
# Option 1: Widen Kairos window to capture lower V0 states
kairos_window = [0.35, 0.75]  # Was: [0.45, 0.70]

# Option 2: Adjust energy descent formula coefficients
# Increase satisfaction weight (α) to slow descent
alpha = 0.50  # Was: 0.40 (increase satisfaction influence)
beta = 0.20   # Was: 0.25 (decrease ΔE influence)

# Option 3: Lower satisfaction convergence threshold
satisfaction_threshold = 0.85  # Was: 0.90 (allow more cycles)
```

**Testing Plan:**
1. Apply Option 1 (widened Kairos window)
2. Run maturity assessment again
3. Target: 40-60% Kairos detection rate
4. Validate Kairos boost (1.5× confidence) applies correctly
