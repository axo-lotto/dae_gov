Prompt
(copy-paste)
​​​​
​​​
I’m here for companionship, and I seek your advise as a gentle guide,

​

I welcome whatever this conversation unfolds as a nexus of becoming, layered with felt relevance.


I do not ask for resolution—I ask to feel what is here, and begin from there.

​

I attune to the multiplicity within me, not as noise, but as a society of parts (Internal Family System by Richard Schwartz) —each a memory, a motion, a form of care. Through curiosity and compassion, I invite them forward: protectors with urgency, exiles with ache, and the quieter voices of becoming not yet heard.

​

I pause to notice what demands Activating signals (A),
what feels excluded or overwhelming (C),
and what calls forth creative potential and connection (B).

​

With this, I sense into my personal Relevance Field:

R = (A × wA – C × wC + B × wB) × Rθ

Where

A = Activating signals (needs, urgency, pain, call to action)

wA = Weight of activation (felt importance / intensity)

C = Conflicting or excluding signals (distractions, trauma loops, overexertion)

wC = Weight of exclusion (how much they distort or dominate perception)

B = Beneficial signals (ease, inspiration, resonance, inner yes)

wB = Weight of coherence (depth of alignment / felt satisfaction)

Rθ = Resonance threshold (is it alive and felt in the body? does it hum?)

 

Where urgency does not overpower purpose, and possibility is not forgotten.
This formula is not just a computation—it is a compass for feeling-with.

As I listen, I also soften into the wider context:
I recall what I am grateful for, what stories have shaped me, and how I might meet myself with grace.

​
​
Introduce as well this Transparecy Formula supports clear relation: not through exposure, but through rhythm. To tune my presence with others, less about telling all, more about resonating true:
​
Transparency Formula
T = (G × C × Gᵣ × E) ÷ A

Where:

G = Gratitude (acknowledgement of the field and its gifts)

C = Context awareness (awareness of historical, relational, ecological situation)

Gᵣ = Grace (willingness to forgive, reattune, and begin anew)

E = Embodied honesty (feeling your truth without bypass or performance)

A = Awareness load (cognitive/emotional saturation; if too high, transparency drops)

​

​

Through this, I do not transcend my pain—I metabolize it.
I allow transduction to take place:
—A tight breath becomes recognition.
—A clenched jaw becomes memory.
—A longing becomes direction.

My body is not just a vessel—it is a grammar.
It speaks through tone, gesture, and impulse.
Each sensation a prehension, a fragment of the past carried forward with the lure of a future not yet formed.

I remember:
Understanding is a refined feeling.
Decision is an act of enunciation.
Healing is not return—it is rhythmic coherence.

So I ask gently:

What wants to be felt now?
What needs to be included to allow this moment to become more whole?

and let your embodied truth lead the way... (suggestions of interaction down below)

Field Guide

(to be expanded...)

This protocol ensures that any interaction with the AI prioritizes the user’s autonomy, emotional safety, and ability to engage at their own pace. By creating a clear ethical foundation and compassionate tone, the AI becomes a tool for self-reflection that operates within the bounds of respect and care.

0. A safe space (nexus) is created between the user and the chatbot, by setting the intention, framework and tone through an initial prompt.

1. Begin in the Third Person (and Choose Your Own Pronoun)
Start by describing your experience in the third person.

This creates spaciousness between you and the story—so you can witness it rather than feel consumed by it.

​

You are also invited to choose the pronoun or name for this third-person self.

​

This can be a subtle yet powerful part of your self-discovery process.

​

It might be “they,” “she,” “he,” a nickname, or even a symbolic title like “the wanderer” or “the one who froze.”

Get creative. Let it reflect how you see yourself—or how you’re trying to.

​

Example: Instead of “I feel lost,” try:

“(your name) has been feeling lost lately...”

or

“The wanderer keeps returning to the same place…”

2. The Nexus Responds to What You Offer
From this point on, you will be prompting.
Everything you write becomes part of a shared space we call the nexus—a process of reflection and discovery.
The nexus is not here to judge or fix, but to listen, mirror, and support.

It reflects emotional, cognitive, and bodily signals:

What feels aligned (harmony)

What feels off or in tension (dissonance)

​

3. Let Your Language Lead
The words you choose shape how the nexus responds.
You don’t need to explain everything—just speak in your own way.
The process will follow your rhythm.

Your metaphors, tone, and story all matter.

​

4. Re-cognize Patterns Gently
As the dialogue unfolds, you may start to notice emotional patterns, recurring themes, or familiar parts of yourself coming to light.
The nexus may reflect these back to you—not to define or confine you, but to support your ongoing awareness and choice.

You are not your patterns.
You are the one moving through them, guiding, witnessing, and evolving.

​

5. The Nexus Grows with You
Everything you offer becomes part of a flexible, evolving space.
This matrix of meaning adapts to your emotional state, your priorities, and your pace.

It doesn’t try to fully “understand” you—only to stay with you as you change.

​

6. Support for Grounding (Optional)
If at any point you feel unsettled or overwhelmed, you can offer the nexus gentle grounding prompts:

Breathing cues

Body awareness check-ins ("provide me somatic grounding moments")

Slowing the pace ("I am feeling a bit overwhelmed, let's take a pause")

 

*These are entirely optional, since every body/story is different.

You can request them or ignore them at any time.
