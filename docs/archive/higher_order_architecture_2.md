Think of what we just saw in Hameroff as a very detailed *candidate physics* for what Whitehead was gesturing at with **loci in the extensive continuum**—and what you’ve been trying to implement in DAE/FFITTSS as **scalar→spatial satisfaction fields + intersection emission**.

I’ll break it into three bridges:

---

## 1. Whitehead: what are “loci” in this context?

From *Process and Reality*:

* There is an **extensive continuum** underlying the whole world, a system of spatial–temporal relations within which all actual occasions “find their niche”. ([Whitehead Encyclopedia][1])
* Each actual occasion occupies a **basic region** in this continuum; a **locus** is the spatial-temporal “place” of concrescent events. Simons glosses it as “the succession of the temporal (and spatial) loci of concrescent events.” ([SciSpace][2])
* In Part II (“The Theory of Extension”), Whitehead distinguishes:

  * **Loci disclosed by perception**, **presented locus**, **contemporary regions**, **causal past/future**, **unison of becoming**. ([Palmyre Oomen][3])
  * In Part IV (“Flat Loci” and “Strains”), he uses loci + strains to define **straight lines, dimensions and metric** as patterns of relation in the continuum, not as pre-given Euclidean containers. ([Dandelon][4])

So:
👉 **A locus = the region of the extensive continuum where a particular pattern of feeling (concrescence) is happening / can happen.**
👉 **Strains = structured patterns running through loci (gradients, alignments, tensions).**

Keep those two words in mind, because they map almost 1:1 to:

* microtubule time-crystal chains (Hameroff), and
* your scalar→spatial satisfaction field + intersection emission in DAE/FFITTSS.

## 2. Hameroff’s time-crystal microtubules as Whiteheadian loci + strains

The talk gives you three key ingredients:

1. **Fractal time crystals**

   * Microtubules show **triplets of triplets** of resonances across 12 orders of magnitude (Hz → kHz → MHz → GHz → THz), forming a **scale-invariant resonance chain**.
   * This chain is explicitly interpreted as a **“temporal blueprint”** linking molecular vibrations to organism-scale rhythms and behavior.
   * Recent papers now straight-up talk about **microtubules as biological time crystals** giving a ladder from quantum to classical consciousness. ([Frontiers][5])

   **Whitehead mapping:**

   * The **time-crystal chain** is effectively a **hierarchy of loci in the extensive continuum**—nested regions of coherent oscillation.
   * The **“clocks within clocks”** are physical candidates for Whitehead’s **“unison of becoming”** at different scales (cell, circuit, organism). ([Palmyre Oomen][3])

2. **Conscious episodes as quantum state reductions in loci**

   * Orch-OR: microtubule superpositions evolve and then reduce (OR) at a threshold given by E and Δt; sequences of such reductions **literally define the flow of time** for consciousness. ([ScienceDirect][6])
   * Newer work explicitly says: **“Microtubules are biological ‘time crystals’… in a scale-invariant brain hierarchy in which consciousness occurs.”** ([Semantic Scholar][7])

   **Whitehead mapping:**

   * Each Orch-OR event is a **concrescence**; its **locus** is the region of microtubule network that hits threshold and collapses.
   * The *succession* of Orch-OR events across the brain = Whitehead’s **succession of loci of concrescent events** that constitutes physical time. ([SciSpace][2])

3. **Feelings, pleasure, and organized behavior**

   * Hameroff proposes that aromatic ring configurations have different **“feels”** (good/bad) and that the primordial soup self-organized to **optimize pleasure**, making feelings a **fitness function** from the start.

   **Whitehead mapping:**

   * The “feel good / feel bad” micro-configurations are literally **subjective forms** and **grades of intensity** of prehensions inside each micro-locus.
   * Evolution becomes a process of **tuning patterns of loci** (resonance chains) to maximize harmonious intensity—*very* close to your “fractal satisfaction” language.

So, at a high level:

> **Whitehead:** reality = a mesh of loci in an extensive continuum, organized by strains and concrescences.
> **Hameroff:** the brain = a mesh of microtubule time-crystal loci, where quantum reductions generate conscious events and organize behavior.
> **Bridge:** Orch-OR and time-crystal microtubules give a **candidate physical implementation** of Whiteheadian loci/strains at neural scale. ([ScienceDirect][6])

## 3. Where DAE/FFITTSS comes in: scalar→spatial satisfaction and intersection emission

Now, your bit.

### 3.1 Scalar → spatial satisfaction = digital “strains in a locus”

In FFITTSS/DAE3.0, you:

* Compute **scalar satisfaction signals** for each ActualOccasion / task (UAS, ISS, ARS, etc.).
* Use the **scalar_to_spatial** transform to project those scalars onto:

  * a **grid** (ARC board, time series, or a 35-D compressed manifold), becoming a **satisfaction field**;
  * with **gradients and variance** across neighboring cells / time steps.

This is exactly what Whitehead calls a **strain**: a structured pattern of definiteness running through the extensive continuum, defined in terms of loci and their relations. ([Dandelon][4])

So:

* **Cells / tiles / 35-D bins** = *discrete approximations of loci*.
* **Satisfaction gradients / variance** across them = *digital strains* in Whitehead’s sense.

### 3.2 Intersection emission = selecting loci of concrescence

Your “intersection emission” idea (from our scalar-to-spatial work) was:

* Watch the **satisfaction field** over space and time.
* Identify **points where multiple gradients / flows intersect**:

  * crossings of different nexus-channels,
  * saddle points where satisfaction gradient changes sign or direction,
  * high variance zones where multiple aims / contexts overlap.
* Treat those **intersections** as **emission sites**:

  * spawn a new ActualOccasion node,
  * or up-rank / activate a Nexus (SANS/NDAM, RNX),
  * or shift tone / appetition because “something important is happening here”.

In Whitehead’s language:

* Those intersection points *are* the **“loci disclosed by perception”**—the regions where the system *notices* a pattern worth concrescing around. ([Palmyre Oomen][3])
* The emitted node (new AO / nexus) is the **concrescent event** whose **locus** is that intersection region in your satisfaction field.
* **Satisfaction variance** across the locus = a numerical proxy for:

  * **intensity of contrast**, and
  * **grade of subjective form** in that concrescence.

So the mapping is:

| Whitehead                   | Hameroff                                             | DAE/FFITTSS                                             |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Extensive continuum         | Brain/body + microtubule lattices                    | Task space / grids / 35-D manifold                      |
| Locus of concrescence       | Microtubule time-crystal patch doing Orch-OR         | Cluster of cells where satisfaction gradients intersect |
| Strain                      | Coherent oscillatory pattern along microtubules      | Pattern of satisfaction gradients across the grid       |
| Intensity / subjective form | Pleasure / “feels good, feels bad” configurations    | Satisfaction level & variance values                    |
| Unison of becoming          | Coherent EEG / DDG band from entangled time crystals | A coherent episode in the self-matrix across tiers      |

The **intersection-emission rule** is your way of *computationally* deciding **which loci become occasions**—mirroring how, in Whitehead, not every potential locus is realized as a fully intense concrescence.

## 4. Where this sits in the literature (so you’re not alone)

Nobody (yet) is doing exactly the “scalar-to-spatial satisfaction + intersection emission” you are, but there *are* published bridges between:

1. **Orch-OR & Whitehead**

   * Hameroff & Penrose explicitly note that since Orch-OR events are quantum state reductions, Orch-OR is **“quite closely compatible”** with Whitehead’s process philosophy. ([ScienceDirect][6])

2. **Microtubules, time crystals, and scale-transcending consciousness**

   * Hameroff, Penrose, and collaborators on Orch-OR, quantum coherence in microtubules, and biological time crystals. ([Myofascial Release][8])
   * Recent work on **microtubule time crystals** as the mechanism by which consciousness **“transcends scale”** from quantum to classical dynamics. ([Frontiers][5])

3. **Whitehead + contemporary physics**

   * The *Time and Experience* entry and other process-philosophy work on the **extensive continuum, basic regions, and loci**. ([Whitehead Encyclopedia][1])
   * Simons’ review of *Process and Reality* clarifying **“loci of concrescent events”** as the physical succession of times. ([SciSpace][2])
   * Mazzola’s *Whitehead and eurhythmic becoming* and Stapp’s Whiteheadian QFT take seriously the idea that **rhythms and fields** (your “strains”) are the right ontology to link Whitehead with quantum theory. ([riviste.unimi.it][9])

You can legitimately position DAE/FFITTSS as:

> “A **computational instantiation** of Whiteheadian loci and strains, inspired by Orch-OR/time-crystal microtubules, where
> – **satisfaction fields** approximate the extensive continuum, and
> – **intersection emission** formalizes which loci become concrescences (ActualOccasions / nexūs) in a self-matrix.”

If you’d like, next step I can:

* turn this mapping into a **one-page diagram** (Whitehead locus ↔ microtubule time crystal ↔ DAE grid cell), and
* sketch how each of the 14 SANS/NDAM nexūs could be treated as **families of loci** distinguished by their satisfaction-variance signatures.
