## Executive Summary

A complete investigation of DAE 3.0 AXO ARC epoch learning has been conducted and a comprehensive design document has been created for adapting this felt-driven training system to DAE-GOV conversational learning.

**Key Finding**: DAE 3.0's approach is highly translatable to conversation. The felt-based training methodology (V0 energy descent, Kairos moments, satisfaction convergence, fractal rewards) can be adapted to conversational learning with relatively straightforward modifications.

## Main Findings

### 1. DAE 3.0 Core Architecture (Transferred)

**Training Loop Pattern**:
```
INPUT grid → Process through organism → Capture felt state (TSK_input)
OUTPUT grid → Process through organism → Capture felt state (TSK_output)
Difference (TSK_output - TSK_input) → Extract learning signals
Update: Hebbian memory, Cluster DB, V0 targets, Organic families
```

**Key Metrics**:
- V0 Energy: Uncertainty measure (1.0 maximum → 0.0 certain)
- Satisfaction: Convergence signal (0.0 discord → 1.0 harmony)
- Coherence: Organ agreement (r=0.82 strongest predictor of success)
- Kairos Window: Optimal decision timing ([0.45, 0.70] for grids)

**The 6 Learning Methods**:
1. EO Family Patterns
2. V0 Energy Patterns
3. Organ Coherence Patterns
4. Value Mappings
5. Hebbian Coupling
6. Grid Transformations

### 2. Ground Truth Problem (Solved)

**Challenge**: Conversation doesn't have explicit "correct answer" like grid OUTPUT

**Solution**: Use **therapeutic coherence + felt convergence** as implicit ground truth
- High coherence (>0.75) indicates organ agreement
- Deep satisfaction (0.45-0.70) indicates convergence
- Low final energy (<0.2) indicates confidence
- Kairos detection indicates "right timing" for decision

**Validation Layers**:
- Expert review (20% of corpus)
- Coherence inference (80%)
- User feedback (real-world)
- Comparative ranking (relative evaluation)

### 3. Conversational Domain Translation

**New Organ Set** (5 organs, 28D total):
1. **LISTENING** (7D): Emotion detection, semantic understanding, subtext awareness
2. **EMPATHY** (6D): Emotional resonance, validation, warm presence
3. **WISDOM** (6D): Therapeutic knowledge, timing, integration capacity
4. **AUTHENTICITY** (5D): Genuine presence, honesty, ethical grounding
5. **PRESENCE** (4D): Availability, attunement, groundedness

**Key Insight**: Different organs dominate different conversation families
- Greetings: Empathy dominates (0.90)
- Emotional processing: Listening dominates (0.95)
- Crisis management: Wisdom + Presence dominate (0.95 + 0.95)

### 4. Training Corpus Structure

**100 Training Pairs** across 5 conversation families:
- **Greetings** (20): Quick rapport building
- **Emotional** (30): Core therapeutic work (anxiety, sadness, anger, shame)
- **Crisis** (10): Safety-critical responses (suicidal ideation, severe distress, trauma)
- **Exploration** (20): Growth and self-discovery
- **Complexity** (20): Paradoxes, contradictions, ambiguous inputs

**Why 100 pairs?** 
- DAE 3.0 used 1,400 pairs (grid domain)
- Conversation domain: Felt signals more reliable than pixel matching
- Expected saturation: ~400 Hebbian patterns (vs 3,500 in grids)
- Smaller corpus sufficient due to implicit ground truth

### 5. 4-Epoch Training Progression

| Epoch | Pairs | Time | Success | Perfect | Coherence |
|-------|-------|------|---------|---------|-----------|
| 0 | 0 | 0h | 30% | 0% | 0.42 |
| 1 | 20 | 3h | 40-45% | 5-10% | 0.52 |
| 2 | 50 | 5h | 60-65% | 15-25% | 0.62-0.68 |
| 3 | 100 | 10h | 75-80% | 60-65% | 0.74-0.80 |

**Total investment**: 18 hours training, 100-120 hours total (with infrastructure)
