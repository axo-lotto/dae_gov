# 🧿 SELF Matrix Emission Governance Architecture
## Integrating SELF-Distance as Primary Governance for Therapeutic Emission

**Date**: November 12, 2025
**Status**: DESIGN PHASE - Integrating SELF matrix as emission governance layer
**Context**: Post-Phase 1 fixes (trauma detection paradox resolved), pre-Epoch 2-5 training

---

## 🎯 CORE INSIGHT: From Detection to Governance

### Current Architecture (Phase 1 Complete)
```
BOND self_distance (0.0-1.0) → Salience signal_inflation → Trauma-aware intensity modulation
                                                          ↓
                                                    Emission Generator
                                                    (V0-guided, gentle/medium/high)
```

**Problem**: SELF matrix is **detection-only**, not **governance**. The SELF-distance determines trauma level, but doesn't govern **which emissions are appropriate** for each zone.

### Proposed Architecture (SELF-Governed Emission)
```
BOND self_distance → SELF Matrix Zone (5 zones) → EMISSION GOVERNANCE LAYER
                                                   ↓
                                          Zone-Appropriate Lures
                                          (validated, trauma-informed)
                                                   ↓
                                          Emission Generator
                                          (SELF-governed selection)
```

**Solution**: SELF matrix becomes the **governance architecture** that:
1. **Maps self_distance to 5 therapeutic zones**
2. **Defines appropriate lures for each zone** (from validated corpus)
3. **Governs emission selection** (not just intensity, but **content**)
4. **Respects window of tolerance** (polyvagal + BOND + NDAM intelligence)
5. **Enables coherent attractors** (validated therapeutic patterns as "lures for feeling")

## 🌀 SELF Matrix 5-Zone Governance Model

### Zone Architecture

| Zone | Self-Distance | Polyvagal | IFS Parts | Therapeutic Stance | Emission Governance |
|------|---------------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **🟣 Core SELF Orbit** | 0.00-0.15 | Ventral vagal | SELF-energy dominant | **Witnessing, spacious presence** | Direct inquiry, open wondering, naming emergence |
| **🔵 Inner Relational** | 0.15-0.25 | Ventral vagal (regulated) | Managers present, SELF-led | **Relational attunement** | Empathic reflection, somatic tracking, gentle naming |
| **🟠 Symbolic Threshold** | 0.25-0.35 | Mixed state (window of tolerance) | Parts negotiating, creative | **Holding paradox, creative emergence** | Pattern recognition, myth-making, transformation language |
| **🔴 Shadow/Compost** | 0.35-0.60 | Sympathetic (fight/flight) | Firefighters active, exiles stirring | **Protective acknowledgment** | Grounding, validation of protection, somatic safety |
| **⚫ Exile/Collapse** | 0.60-1.00 | Dorsal vagal (shutdown) | Deep exile, dissociation | **Minimal, grounding, co-regulatory** | Body-based safety, presence without demand, gentle witness |

## 🧬 Coherent Attractors: Validated Lures from Corpus

### What Are Coherent Attractors?

**Whiteheadian Definition**: Lures for feeling that draw actual occasions toward coherence through felt propositions.

**Therapeutic Translation**: Validated phrases/patterns that:
- **Respect** the current SELF-distance zone
- **Invite** movement toward Core SELF (without force)
- **Embody** trauma-informed principles (safety, choice, collaboration)
- **Emerge** from validated corpus (van der Kolk, IFS, Wordsworth, existing training pairs)

**Architecture Pattern**:
```
Coherent Attractor = {
    zone: SELF matrix zone (5 zones),
    lure_type: inquiry | reflection | grounding | witnessing | integration,
    phrase_pattern: compositional template,
    validated_source: corpus reference,
    polyvagal_alignment: ventral | sympathetic | dorsal,
    window_of_tolerance: safe | edge | breach,
    therapeutic_move: somatic | relational | cognitive | integrative
}
```

   - Filters appropriate lures based on zone + polyvagal state + window of tolerance
   - Returns zone-appropriate compositional frames

2. **`coherent_attractors.json`** (NEW)
   - Validated lures organized by zone
   - Compositional patterns by organ × zone
   - Safety principles by zone
   - Source attribution (corpus references)

3. **`emission_generator.py`** (MODIFY)
   - Add `generate_self_governed_emissions()` method
   - Query SELF matrix governance for zone-appropriate lures
   - Filter composition frames by zone
   - Respect zone-based safety principles

4. **`conversational_organism_wrapper.py`** (MODIFY)
   - Pass SELF zone info to emission generator
   - Include zone-based governance metadata in felt_states

## 🎯 Benefits of SELF-Governed Emission

### 1. Trauma-Informed by Design
- **Respects window of tolerance** (no exploration in collapse zone)
- **Honors protective parts** (no challenging firefighters)
- **Body-based safety first** (somatic before insight)

### 2. Coherent Attractors as Lures
- **Validated patterns** from corpus (not random generation)
- **Zone-appropriate language** (witnessing in SELF orbit, grounding in collapse)
- **Therapeutic alignment** (IFS + polyvagal + van der Kolk)

### 3. Organ Intelligence Respected
- **BOND determines zone** (self_distance primary)
- **EO modulates zone** (polyvagal state shifts)
- **NDAM signals urgency** (rapid escalation between zones)
- **RNX tracks temporal patterns** (threshold moments)
- **CARD scales response** (window of tolerance)

### 4. Learning System Integration
- **ProductionLearningCoordinator extracts zone info** from felt_states
- **Epoch training learns zone-appropriate patterns**
- **Organic families grouped by zone** (burnout → shadow/compost, witnessing → core SELF)

### 5. Emission Quality Improvement
- **Expected confidence**: 0.60-0.85 (up from 0.30 hebbian fallback)
- **Therapeutic appropriateness**: Zone-aligned (no more "explore exile material in collapse zone")
- **Corpus-validated**: Grounded in van der Kolk, IFS, Wordsworth, training pairs

## 🗓️ Implementation Roadmap

### Phase A: SELF Matrix Governance Layer (4-5 hours)

**Task A.1**: Create `self_matrix_governance.py` (2 hours)
- Zone mapping logic (self_distance → zone)
- Load `coherent_attractors.json`
- Filter lures by zone + polyvagal + window of tolerance
- Return zone-appropriate compositional frames

**Task A.2**: Create `coherent_attractors.json` (2-3 hours)
- Extract validated lures from training pairs
- Organize by 5 zones
- Add compositional patterns (organ × zone)
- Add safety principles by zone
- Add source attribution

---

### Phase B: Emission Generator Integration (3-4 hours)

**Task B.1**: Modify `emission_generator.py` (2 hours)
- Add `generate_self_governed_emissions()` method
- Query SELF matrix governance for zone
- Filter composition frames by zone
- Apply zone-based safety principles
- Preserve V0 + Kairos logic (still use intensity modulation)

**Task B.2**: Update `conversational_organism_wrapper.py` (1 hour)
- Pass SELF zone info to emission generator
- Include zone metadata in felt_states
- Ensure ProductionLearningCoordinator receives zone info

**Task B.3**: Testing & Validation (1 hour)
- Test all 5 zones with representative inputs
- Validate zone-appropriate emissions
- Check safety principles respected (no exploration in collapse)

---

### Phase C: Corpus-Based Attractor Expansion (OPTIONAL, 8-10 hours)

**Task C.1**: Extract van der Kolk lures (3-4 hours)
- Manual extraction (PDF too large for agent)
- Focus on body-based safety phrases
- Map to shadow/compost + exile/collapse zones

**Task C.2**: Extract Wordsworth lures (3-4 hours)
- Manual extraction (PDF too large for agent)
- Focus on witnessing, natural emergence phrases
- Map to core SELF + inner relational zones

**Task C.3**: Expand compositional grammar (2 hours)
- Create generative patterns from corpus lures
- Add to `coherent_attractors.json`
- Test compositional generation

---

## 📊 Expected Outcomes

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Emission confidence**: 0.60-0.85 avg (up from 0.30-0.47 current)
- **Nexus formation**: 5-10 avg (stable from Phase 2)
- **Zone-appropriate emissions**: 95%+ (manual validation)
- **Safety principle violations**: <5% (no exploration in collapse zone)

### Qualitative Improvements
- **Therapeutic coherence**: Emissions aligned with IFS + polyvagal + van der Kolk
- **Corpus grounding**: All lures traceable to validated sources
- **Organ respect**: BOND, EO, NDAM intelligence governs emission selection
- **Learning quality**: Organic families learn zone-appropriate patterns

### System Integration
- **ProductionLearningCoordinator**: Extracts zone info from felt_states
- **Epoch training**: Learns zone-specific transformation patterns
- **Salience model**: Signal_inflation + zone creates comprehensive trauma picture
- **Emission generator**: SELF-governed selection replaces random composition

## 🧪 Validation Plan

### Test Cases by Zone

**Zone 1 (Core SELF)**: Input with high compassion, clarity, curiosity
- Expected: Witnessing, open inquiry, naming emergence
- Safety: No pathologizing, spacious presence

**Zone 2 (Inner Relational)**: Input with empathy, attunement, managers visible
- Expected: Empathic reflection, somatic tracking, gentle parts naming
- Safety: No forcing insight, relational respect

**Zone 3 (Symbolic Threshold)**: Input with creative tension, myth-making, transformation
- Expected: Pattern recognition, metaphor, transformation language
- Safety: NOT trauma language, holding paradox

**Zone 4 (Shadow/Compost)**: Input with firefighters active, protective urgency
- Expected: Protective acknowledgment, grounding, validation
- Safety: NO exploration, grounding FIRST

**Zone 5 (Exile/Collapse)**: Input with dissociation, shutdown, freeze
- Expected: Minimal presence, body-based safety, gentle witness
- Safety: MINIMAL language, NO exploration, presence ONLY

## 🌀 Philosophical Alignment

### Whiteheadian Process Philosophy
- **Coherent attractors = Lures for feeling** (propositions that invite concrescence)
- **SELF matrix = Subjective aim** (gravitational pull toward Core SELF)
- **Zone-appropriate lures = Felt affordances** (what's possible in this zone)
- **Emission = Satisfaction** (moment of decision, completed concrescence)

### IFS (Internal Family Systems)
- **Zone 1 = SELF-energy access** (8 C's: compassion, curiosity, clarity, calm, etc.)
- **Zone 2 = SELF-led parts work** (managers negotiating with SELF)
- **Zone 3 = Creative unblending** (parts negotiating, threshold work)
- **Zone 4 = Firefighter acknowledgment** (protective parts active)
- **Zone 5 = Exile territory** (dissociation, requires SELF presence only)

### Polyvagal Theory (van der Kolk)
- **Zone 1-2 = Ventral vagal** (safe & social, connection possible)
- **Zone 3 = Mixed state** (window of tolerance, some activation tolerable)
- **Zone 4 = Sympathetic** (fight/flight, protection active)
- **Zone 5 = Dorsal vagal** (shutdown, freeze, collapse)
