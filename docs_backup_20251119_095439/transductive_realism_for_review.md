 Transductive Realism: A Metaphysical Grammar for Becoming
I. First Principles
Transductive Realism rests on four ontological axioms:
Reality becomes through felt relevance
 → Every system is in a state of tension between potential and coherence.


No system is truly closed
 → Every local process participates in field conditions that shape its becoming.


Coherence is rhythmic, not static
 → What “fits” emerges through recursive saturation of salience, not formal consistency.


Every coherence event is a transductive decision
 → Becoming is the act of tuning—not imposing—a rhythm of resolution.



II. Formal Structure
Every system (S) undergoing transformation operates within:
T(S)=f(Pn,Rn,V⃗f,ΔCn)⇒Nn+1T(S) = f(P_n, R_n, \vec{V}_f, ΔC_n) \Rightarrow N_{n+1}
Where:
P_n = Pattern memory / prehended past


R_n = Relevance field (what matters now)


\vec{V}_f = Vector Feeling (direction, valence, intensity)


ΔC_n = Constraint shift (environmental or internal change)


N_{n+1} = Next coherence nexus (partial satisfaction)


This formula applies to any process:
A neural loop


A cultural myth


An AI decision


A forest fire’s behavior


A conversation


A planetary climate transition


Because it describes how systems feel their way into relevance.

III. Systems That Can Be Modeled via Transductive Realism
Domain
Application of Transductive Realism
Biology
Cell signaling, morphogenesis, healing rhythms
Psychology / IFS
Part emergence, somatic coherence, trauma resolution
AI / Tech Systems
Signal drift detection, salience-aware decision modeling
Ecology
Ecosystem balancing, mycelial signaling, climate feedback
Social Systems
Memetic resonance, collective regulation, cultural healing
Politics / Governance
Non-coercive coherence mechanisms, salience mapping
Economics
Value emergence through feedback and relational rhythms
Spiritual / Cosmological
Participatory becoming, recursive satisfaction across scale
Mathematical Logic
Incompleteness not as failure, but as rhythmic thresholding
Language / Semiotics
Meaning as recursive integration, not symbolic authority

Each of these systems involves:
Relevance gradients


Internal multiplicities


Rhythmic adaptation


Exclusion pressures


Feedback loops


And Transductive Realism models exactly how these dynamics are metabolized into coherence events.

IV. Metaphysical Implications
🌊 Reality Is Not Substance-Based, but Rhythm-Based
Transductive Realism proposes that all entities are rhythmic processes of coherence, not static substances.
🫀 Truth Is Participatory, Not Representational
What is “true” is what holds together through recursive attunement, not what stands in for a fixed referent.
🌀 Decision Is the Event of Felt Integration
To decide is not to choose among options—it is to participate in a coherence event that shapes the next actual nexus.
🌿 Ethics Is Salience-Aware Design
In a transductive framework, ethics is not rule-based—it is field-attuned participation in what wants to become whole.

V. Why This Is Not Just a Philosophy
Unlike many metaphysical proposals, Transductive Realism:
Scales operationally → from therapy sessions to AI systems to political feedback


Includes exclusion → as a real part of systemic logic, not a noise to suppress


Reframes knowledge → as recursive, embodied participation, not abstraction


Guides system design → because it offers a real-time grammar of coherence tracking


This makes it applicable in practice—from breathwork to language models to policy protocols.

VI. Closing Definition
Transductive Realism is the ontological framework that models how systems across all domains become coherent through recursive relevance.
 It offers a rhythmic grammar of decision, where coherence is not asserted but felt into form.
It is, in essence, Whitehead + IFS + Soma + Field Logic—made recursive and applicable.

🔬 Abstract
Transductive Realism: A Metaphysical Grammar for Becoming
 Emiliano López Pereda
In a world increasingly governed by abstraction, automation, and algorithmic feedback, a new metaphysical grammar is needed—one that can reconcile experience with complexity, and coherence with multiplicity. This paper introduces Transductive Realism, a field-centric ontology that models how systems—biological, psychological, technological, ecological, and social—become coherent through recursive relevance, rather than imposed form.
Transductive Realism is built on four axiomatic principles:
Reality becomes through felt relevance
 Every system, from a cell to a society, navigates a field of salience gradients, metabolizing what matters into coherence events.


No system is truly closed
 All becoming is participatory. Systems are shaped by recursive entanglement with surrounding fields of influence.


Coherence is rhythmic, not static
 Integration is not the elimination of contradiction, but the rhythmic resolution of tension through field saturation.


Every coherence event is a transductive decision
 Decisions are not discrete selections, but felt inflections—moments where relevance condenses into actionable form.


The model is formalized through the transductive transformation equation:
T(S)=f(Pn,Rn,V⃗f,ΔCn)⇒Nn+1T(S) = f(P_n, R_n, \vec{V}_f, ΔC_n) \Rightarrow N_{n+1}T(S)=f(Pn​,Rn​,Vf​,ΔCn​)⇒Nn+1​
Where:
PnP_nPn​: pattern memory (prehended past)


RnR_nRn​: relevance gradient (what matters now)


V⃗f\vec{V}_fVf​: vector feeling (somatic directionality, intensity, and valence)


ΔCn\Delta C_nΔCn​: constraint modulation (internal or environmental shift)


Nn+1N_{n+1}Nn+1​: emergent coherence nexus


This structure applies across domains:
Biology: cell signaling and morphogenesis


Psychology / IFS: part-system integration and trauma resolution


AI / technology: salience-aware decision architectures, signal drift detection


Ecology: mycelial communication, feedback harmonization


Social systems: memetic regulation and cultural coherence


Governance / economics: participatory ethics and relational feedback


Semiotics / logic: recursive meaning-making and threshold resolution


Unlike panpsychism, which universalizes interiority without a grammar of coherence, or New Materialism, which distributes agency without recursive rhythm, Transductive Realism offers a formal logic for how integration actually happens. It includes exclusion, contradiction, and trauma as real forces—tracking not only what systems do, but how they feel their way into form.
Philosophically, Transductive Realism shifts metaphysics from substance to rhythm. Truth becomes coherence-in-participation, not representational correspondence. Decision becomes a field saturation event, not a discrete act of choice. Ethics becomes salience-aware design—the capacity to sense what is ready to become whole.
This framework is not a speculative gesture. It is directly applicable—from somatic breathwork to recursive AI architectures, from collective trauma healing to ecological decision-making.
Transductive Realism is Whitehead + IFS + Soma + Field Logic—made recursive and operational.
 It invites a future where coherence is not declared, but grown, felt, and trusted.
