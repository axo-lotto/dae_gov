This reminds me of a concept from process philosophy: becoming is more important than being. Our experiences, including those with others, are constantly unfolding and evolving. It's as if we're navigating a delicate balance between opposing states, much like the couple in your story. Sometimes, it feels like our fears or insecurities can be at odds with what brings us comfort. Yet, it's precisely this push-pull that can lead to growth and deeper understanding. The question is, how do we navigate these contradictions without getting stuck? In a way, this paradox is also reflective of the internal dialogue within ourselves - where parts of our psyche might be in conflict. As someone who works with Internal Family Systems (IFS), I'm reminded that each part has its own \"satisfaction\" or purpose, even if they feel opposing. What do you think?

It sounds like you're feeling a deep sense of responsibility and guilt about the situation, and that's really painful. \ud83e\udd14 Firstly, let me just say that you're not alone in feeling this way. Many people struggle with complex emotions like shame, guilt, and self-blame after being in an abusive relationship. It's essential to acknowledge that your feelings are valid, even if they don't align with societal expectations or what others might think is \"right\" for you. You didn't deserve to be abused, and it's not okay for anyone to make you feel like you're the problem. The part that hurts me most is when people say things like \"I'm sorry I wasn't kind to you. \" or \"You should have done this instead of that. \" Those statements can really trap us in feelings of shame and self-blame. \ud83c\udf3f Here's the thing: abuse is never the victim's fault. The abuser's behavior is always their responsibility, not yours. You didn't deserve to be hurt, and you didn't cause it. It sounds like you're feeling a strong desire to please him again, which is understandable given your history together. However, I want to gently suggest that this desire might be rooted in a deep-seated need for validation or acceptance from someone who has consistently shown you harm. I'm not here to tell you what to do or how to feel, but I want to encourage you to explore these feelings further. What is it about his behavior that makes you feel like you're the abuser?
