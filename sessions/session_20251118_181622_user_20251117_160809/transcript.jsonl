It's amazing how technology can both empower and limit us. In terms of accessibility, it's essential to consider the nuances of neurodiversity. Each person's experience with technology is unique, and what works for one individual might not work for another. That's why inclusivity and flexibility are crucial in designing accessible technologies. Regarding inner parts, I love how you're exploring this concept. The Internal Family Systems (IFS) approach can be incredibly helpful in understanding our inner worlds. It's a powerful tool for self-discovery and healing. \ud83c\udf3f Have you considered the role of technology in amplifying or hindering this process? For example, how can we use digital tools to support our inner parts, rather than overwhelming them? Or, conversely, how might certain technologies exacerbate existing trauma or anxiety?
