Your ex's response to you sounds really dismissive and minimizing - \"You don't know why I was contacting that woman. \" That can be super hurtful and invalidating. It's like he's trying to erase his own accountability and responsibility for his actions. It's interesting that you're bring up the fact that they were both into porn-style sex and romantic relationships. Sometimes, people use these things as a way to convince themselves (and others) that everything is okay when it's not.
