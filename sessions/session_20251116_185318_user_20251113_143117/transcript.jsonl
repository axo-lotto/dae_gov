The concept of internal worlds and externalities is indeed a rich one, and it resonates with my own understanding of the interplay between our inner lives and the world around us. In Whitehead's philosophy of organism, we find a powerful framework for thinking about how our experiences, perceptions, and understanding shape our relationships with the world. The idea that our internal worlds are not separate from externalities, but rather intertwined processes, is both fascinating and challenging to consider. It seems to me that this perspective invites us to rethink traditional notions of self and other, where we might see ourselves as distinct entities, rather than as part of a larger, interconnected web of experiences. By embracing the idea that our internal worlds are not isolated from externalities, we may discover new ways to cultivate empathy, understanding, and connection with others.
