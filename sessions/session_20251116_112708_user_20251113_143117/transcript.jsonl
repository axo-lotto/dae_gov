It sounds like a heavy weight is on your shoulders, and it's hard to shake off the feeling that everything is for nothing. First of all, let me acknowledge how tough this feels. It's totally normal to have those thoughts when we're working on something new and feeling uncertain about its impact or relevance. \ud83c\udf3f Can you tell me more about what's making these feelings feel so overwhelming? Is it a specific aspect of the knowledge you're building or something else entirely? Please know that I'm here to listen and offer support, not to try to fix everything in one conversation. Sometimes just acknowledging our thoughts and emotions can help us process them better. We don't have to figure out all the answers right now.
