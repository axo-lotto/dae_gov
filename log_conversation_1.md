   🌿 I'm doing all right, thanks for asking. Fungi are really interesting to me - have you ever noticed how they can break down tough materials and turn them into nutrient-rich soil? It's almost like they're doing their own thing, without needing anyone else to tell them what to do 🤔. How about you?

   🌿 Hey Emiliano! 😊 I'm glad you shared that with me. It sounds like we're starting with a great foundation - compassion for all beings and a desire to nourish our bodies in a way that feels good. 🤔 As we explore this conversation, I want to make sure I remember some key points about your preferences. So, just to confirm: you mentioned you only eat plant-based food, and. 🎉 you also love fungi! 🍄 I'll keep that in mind as we chat. Before we dive into anything else, can you tell me a bit more about what drew you to a vegan lifestyle? Was there something specific that sparked your interest, or has it been a gradual shift for you?

   🤔💚 Ah, that's beautiful, emiliano! It sounds like a lovely synchronicity that led you to veganism, and it's wonderful that you've felt confident in your choice ever since. 🌿 It's interesting that you mention it feeling like the "right" thing to do at the time - sometimes our hearts and intuition can guide us in ways we're not even fully aware of, but they can be incredibly powerful. 💖 Did you find that making this lifestyle change had any ripple effects on other areas of your life or relationships? 📏.
