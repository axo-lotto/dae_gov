## Organ Specialization Analysis (FINAL)

### Clear Differentiation Achieved ✅

**1. LISTENING (Relational Attunement)**

**Specialization:** Activates for people, especially safe relationships

| Entity | Type | LISTENING Activation | Pattern |
|--------|------|---------------------|---------|
| **Lily** | Person | 0.73 ⭐ | Safest person, highest LISTENING |
| **Emma** | Person | 0.60 | Complex person, moderate LISTENING |
| **home** | Place | 0.43 | Relational space |
| **deadline** | Concept | 0.45 | Temporal pressure (anomaly) |
| **Alex** | Person | 0.00 ❌ | Work person, no LISTENING |
| **gym** | Place | 0.00 ❌ | Physical space, no LISTENING |

**Key Insight:** LISTENING differentiates safe people (Lily, Emma) from work people (Alex). Organism "listens" to family, not colleagues.

---

**2. NDAM (Crisis Salience / Urgency Detection)**

**Specialization:** Activates ONLY for stress/crisis entities

| Entity | Type | NDAM Activation | Pattern |
|--------|------|----------------|---------|
| **work** | Place | 0.33 ⭐ | Highest stress |
| **deadline** | Concept | 0.25 | Time pressure |
| **Alex** | Person | 0.11 | Work colleague |
| **gym** | Place | 0.11 | Physical activation |
| **Sofia** | Person | 0.17 | Work-life bridge |
| **Lily** | Person | 0.00 ✅ | No crisis |
| **Emma** | Person | 0.00 ✅ | No crisis |
| **kindergarten** | Place | 0.00 ✅ | No crisis |

**Key Insight:** NDAM perfectly differentiates stress entities (work, deadline) from safe entities (Lily, Emma, kindergarten). **This is organic intelligence.**

---

**3. WISDOM (Pattern Recognition / Systems Thinking)**

**Specialization:** Activates for complex entities requiring strategic processing

| Entity | Type | WISDOM Activation | Pattern |
|--------|------|------------------|---------|
| **work** | Place | 0.41 ⭐ | Most complex (work dynamics) |
| **Sofia** | Person | 0.38 | Complex person (family-work bridge) |
| **gym** | Place | 0.25 | Physical discipline patterns |
| **park** | Place | 0.06 | Simple grounding space |
| **Lily** | Person | 0.00 | Simple relational presence |
| **Emma** | Person | 0.00 | Direct relational connection |

**Key Insight:** WISDOM activates for entities requiring strategic thinking (work, adult relationships). Organism uses different processing for simple presence (Lily) vs complex dynamics (work).

---

**4. PRESENCE (Embodied Awareness / Grounding)**

**Specialization:** Activates for grounding entities and safe relationships

| Entity | Type | PRESENCE Activation | Pattern |
|--------|------|-------------------|---------|
| **park** | Place | 0.68 ⭐ | Strongest grounding space |
| **Lily** | Person | 0.59 | Safe relational presence |
| **deadline** | Concept | 0.47 | Urgency requires presence |
| **home** | Place | 0.44 | Embodied home space |
| **gym** | Place | 0.39 | Physical embodiment |

**Key Insight:** PRESENCE differentiates grounding spaces (park) from activating spaces (gym). Organism feels most embodied at park.

---

**5. EMPATHY (Compassionate Presence)**

**Specialization:** Activates for vulnerable contexts

| Entity | Type | EMPATHY Activation | Pattern |
|--------|------|------------------|---------|
| **kindergarten** | Place | 0.50 ⭐ | Early childhood vulnerability |
| **park** | Place | 0.24 | Safe outdoor space |
| **Emma** | Person | 0.17 | Daughter |
| **Sofia** | Person | 0.12 | Person |
| **Lily** | Person | 0.10 | Daughter |
| **work** | Place | 0.00 ❌ | No vulnerability |
| **Alex** | Person | 0.00 ❌ | No vulnerability |

**Key Insight:** EMPATHY activates for contexts involving children or vulnerability. Organism distinguishes vulnerable (kindergarten, children) from professional (work, Alex) contexts.

---

**6. BOND (IFS Parts Detection / Self-Energy)**

**Specialization:** Activates for complex relational dynamics

| Entity | Type | BOND Activation | Pattern |
|--------|------|---------------|---------|
| **work** | Place | 0.32 ⭐ | Parts-aware work dynamics |
| **park** | Place | 0.26 | Safe relational space |
| **Sofia** | Person | 0.22 | Complex relationship |
| **Lily** | Person | 0.19 | Relational presence |
| **Alex** | Person | 0.18 | Work relationship |
| **kindergarten** | Place | 0.00 | No parts detected |
| **deadline** | Concept | 0.00 | No parts detected |

**Key Insight:** BOND activates for entities involving parts work (work stress) or complex relationships (Sofia). Lower for simple presence (kindergarten).

---

**7. SANS (Coherence Repair) - Universal Baseline**

**Pattern:** ALL entities show high SANS activation (0.56-1.00)

| Activation Range | Entities | Interpretation |
|------------------|----------|----------------|
| **1.00 (Perfect)** | Emma, Lily, Sofia, home | Core relational entities |
| **0.96-0.99** | work, Alex, park, gym | Secondary entities |
| **0.56** | kindergarten, deadline | Lower frequency entities |

**Key Insight:** SANS is the organism's primary coherence mechanism (expected for felt-guided LLM path). Differentiation exists but all entities require coherence repair.

---

## Co-Occurrence Network (FINAL)

### Relational Hub: **home** (85 mentions)

**Strongest Connections:**
1. **Lily ↔ home** (35) - Daughter at home (safest dyad)
2. **Emma ↔ home** (25) - Daughter at home
3. **Emma ↔ Sofia** (25) - Sibling relationship
4. **Emma ↔ Lily** (20) - Sibling relationship
5. **Lily ↔ Sofia** (15) - Sibling relationship
6. **Lily ↔ park** (15) - Outdoor play space

**Family-Safety Cluster:**
- Lily, Emma, Sofia, home, park

**Work-Stress Cluster:**
- work, deadline, Alex
- Sofia (bridges both clusters)

**Key Insight:** Clear separation between family-safety and work-stress entities. Sofia is the only bridge between domains.

---

## V0 Energy Patterns (Processing Speed)

### Quickest Convergence (Low V0 = Fast Protective Response):

1. **deadline** (0.642) - Fastest response to time pressure ⭐
2. **kindergarten** (0.625) - Quick processing of early childhood context

**Interpretation:** Organism responds QUICKLY to crisis (deadline) and vulnerable contexts (kindergarten). Protective response.

---

### Slowest Convergence (High V0 = Thorough Processing):

1. **Alex** (0.829) - Slowest processing (work person) ⭐
2. **gym** (0.814) - Slow processing (physical activation)
3. **home** (0.810) - Slow processing (complex relational hub)

**Interpretation:** Organism takes MORE TIME to process work relationships (Alex), physical activation (gym), and complex family dynamics (home). Thorough, not rushed.

---

## SELF Distance Patterns (Proximity to Core SELF)

### Closest to SELF (< 0.42):

1. **park** (0.369) - **SAFEST ENTITY, CLOSEST TO SELF** ⭐
2. **Lily** (0.411) - Safe daughter, close to SELF
3. **Sofia** (0.436) - Complex but relatively close

**Interpretation:** Safe, grounding entities (park) and safe relationships (Lily) feel closest to SELF.

---

### Furthest from SELF (> 0.49):

1. **home** (0.507) - Complex relational hub, furthest from SELF
2. **Emma** (0.496) - Mixed relational dynamics
3. **gym** (0.500), **kindergarten** (0.500), **deadline** (0.500)

**Interpretation:** Complex entities (home) and activating entities (gym, deadline) feel more distant from SELF.

---
